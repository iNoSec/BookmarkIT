4960	IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.<br/>
4961	IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.<br/>
4962	IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.<br/>
4963	IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. If the remote computer is configured with a Request Outbound IPsec policy, this might be benign and expected. This can also be caused by the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.<br/>
4965	IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.<br/>
5478	The IPsec Policy Agent service was started.<br/>
5479	IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.<br/>
5480	IPsec Policy Agent failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.<br/>
5483	The IPsec Policy Agent service failed to initialize its RPC server. The service could not be started.<br/>
5484	The IPsec Policy Agent service experienced a critical failure and has shut down. The shutdown of this service can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.<br/>
5485	IPsec Policy Agent failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.<br/>
