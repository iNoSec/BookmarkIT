It is also in the best interests of the tester to verify the countries where servers are being housed. After you have validated the country, review the laws of the specific country before beginning testing. It should not be assumed that the firmâ€™s legal team will provide a complete synopsis of local laws for the testers. It should also not be assumed that the firm will take legal responsibility for any laws violated by its testers. It is the responsibility of each tester to verify the laws for each region they are testing in before they begin testing because it will be the tester who ultimately will have to answer for any transgressions.</body></html>
