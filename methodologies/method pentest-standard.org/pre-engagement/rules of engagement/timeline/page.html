A clear timeline should be established for the engagement. While scope defines the start and the end of an engagement, the rules of engagement define everything in between. It should be understood that the timeline will change as the test progresses. However, having a rigid timeline is not the goal of creating one. Rather, having a timeline in place at the beginning of a test will allow everyone involved to more clearly identify the work that is to be done and the people who will be responsible for said work. GANTT Charts and Work Breakdown Structures are often used to define the work and the amount of time that each specific piece of the work will take. Seeing the schedule broken down in this manner aids those involved in identifying where resources need to be applied and it helps the customer identify possible roadblocks which many be encountered during testing.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of free GANTT Chart tools available on the Internet. Many mangers identify closely with these tools. Because of this, they are an excellent medium for communicating with the upper management of a target organization.</body></html>
