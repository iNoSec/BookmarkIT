The aim of this section of the PTES is to present and explain the tools and techniques available which aid in a successful pre-engagement step of a penetration test. The information within this section is the result of the many years of combined experience of some of the most successful penetration testers in the world.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a customer looking for penetration test we strongly recommend going to the General Questions section of this document. It covers the major questions that should be answered before a test begins. Remember, a penetration test should not be confrontational. It should not be an activity to see if the tester can &quot;hack&quot; you. It should be about identifying the business risk associated with and attack.<br/>
<br/>
To get maximum value, make sure the questions in this document are covered. Further, as the Scoping activity progresses, a good testing firm will start to ask additional questions tailored to your organization.</body></html>
