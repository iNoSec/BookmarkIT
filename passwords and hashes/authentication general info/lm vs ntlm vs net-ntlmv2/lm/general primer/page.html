<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>LM-hashes is the oldest password storage used by Windows, dating back to OS/2 in the 1980â€™s. Due to the limited charset allowed, they are fairly easy to crack. You can <b>obtain them</b>, if still available,<b>from the SAM database</b>on a Windows system, or the <b>NTDS database on the Domain Controller</b>.<br/>
<br/>
LM was turned off by default starting in Windows Vista/Server 2008, but might still linger in a network if there older systems are still used. It is possible to enable it in later versions through a GPO setting (even Windows 2016/10).<br/>
<br/>
When dumping the SAM/NTDS database, they are shown together with the NTHash, before the colon.<br/>
