Control paths in Active Directory are an aggregation of &quot;control relations&quot; between entities of the domain (users, computers, groups, GPO, containers, etc.) which can be visualized as graphs (such as above) and whose purpose is to answer questions like &quot;Who can get 'Domain Admins' privileges ?&quot; or &quot;What resources can a user control ?&quot; and even &quot;Who can read the CEO's emails ?&quot;.</body></html>
