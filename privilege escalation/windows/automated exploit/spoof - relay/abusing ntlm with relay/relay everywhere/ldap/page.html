Relaying to LDAP is a new addition in ntlmrelayx. LDAP is an interesting protocol because it is used to directly query the directory, which contains a lot of interesting information for an attacker. Even more interesting is that most of this information is by default readable by all accounts in the domain (including computer accounts). This is where ntlmrelayx integrates withÂ <a href="https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump">ldapdomaindump</a>, another Fox-IT developed tool. This tool tries to gather as much information as possible from the domain, including users, their group memberships, domain computers and the domain policy.<br/>
