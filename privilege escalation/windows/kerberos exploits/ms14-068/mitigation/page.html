<title>Mitigation</title>
</head><body>Detection:<br/>
Detecting Kerberos attacks is inherently difficult since there are tens of Kerberos tickets generated for each user in a single day (1 TGT and at least 1 TGS each for every file share, SharePoint server, Exchange server, etc. accessed by the user). Furthermore, 99% of Kerberos attacks look like valid Kerberos tickets and communication.<br/>
<br/>
While Microsoft notes that in the attack method they have determined, the event log id, Event 4624 (“An account was successfully logged on”), shows a user mismatch between the security id and account name they also note that a determined attacker is likely to fix this so they match, limiting detection ability: “Please note that this logging will only catch known exploits; there are known methods to write exploits that will bypass this logging.”<br/>
<br/>
Note: After installing the update, for Windows 2008R2 and above, the 4769 Kerberos Service Ticket Operation event log can be used to detect attackers attempting to exploit this vulnerability. This is a high volume event, so it is advisable to only log failures (this will significantly reduce the number of events generated). [From Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-068 – Critical Vulnerability in Kerberos Could Allow Elevation of Privilege]<br/>
<br/>
CERT describes the issue in CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature<br/>
<br/>
“The Microsoft Windows Kerberos KDC fails to properly check for valid signatures in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) included with the Kerberos ticket request. A domain user may forge the information contained in the PAC to request higher user privileges than should be allowed. Since the KDC does not verify the signature correctly, it will award the user the requested privileges, effectively making the user a domain administrator and allowing complete compromise of the entire domain.”<br/>
<br/>
Remediation of an Attack Leveraging this Vulnerability:<br/>
According to Microsoft, if an attacker gets Admin rights to your Active Directory environment, it’s game over.<br/>
<br/>
Remediation<br/>
<br/>
The only way a domain compromise can be remediated with a high level of certainty is a complete rebuild of the domain. An attacker with administrative privilege on a domain controller can make a nearly unbounded number of changes to the system that can allow the attacker to persist their access long after the update has been installed. Therefore it is critical to install the update immediately.</body></html>
