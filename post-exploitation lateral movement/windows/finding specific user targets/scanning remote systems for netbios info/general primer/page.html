Some Windows systems still allow users to query for logged in users via the NetBIOS queries. The information can be queried using the native nbtstat tool. The user name is indicated by “&lt;03&gt;” in the nbtstat results.<br/>
<ul><li>Below is another quick and dirty Windows command line script that will scan remote systems for active Domain Admins sessions. Note: The script can be ran as a non-domain user.</li>
<li>for /F %i in (ips.txt) do @echo [+] Checking %i &amp;&amp; nbtstat -A %i 2&gt;NUL &gt;nbsessions.txt &amp;&amp; FOR /F %n in (admins.txt) DO @type nbsessions.txt | findstr /I %n &gt; NUL &amp;&amp; echo [!] %n was found logged into %i</li>
<li/>
<li>You can also use the nbtscan tool which runs a little faster. It can be downloaded <a href="http://unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html">here</a>. Another basic script example is below.</li>
<li>for /F %i in (ips.txt) do @echo [+] Checking %i &amp;&amp; nbtscan -f %i 2&gt;NUL &gt;nbsessions.txt &amp;&amp; FOR /F %n in (admins.txt) DO @type nbsessions.txt | findstr /I %n &gt; NUL &amp;&amp; echo [!] %n was found logged into %i</li>
<li/>
</ul>
