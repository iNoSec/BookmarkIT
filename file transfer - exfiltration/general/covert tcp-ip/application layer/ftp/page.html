<title>FTP</title>
</head><body>File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Zou et al [130] suggested two covert channels into the FTP. The first one<br/>
encodes covert bits directly into the FTP commands, so if there are N commands, every command will represents<br/>
log2N bits. The second one varies the number of FTP NOOP commands send during idle periods. The number<br/>
of send NOOP commands is equal to the integer value of the covert data. Before sending a new value, an ABOR<br/>
command needs to be sent. For FTP, it is normal to send NOOP or ABOR continually to prevent the control<br/>
connections from entering idle status.</body></html>
