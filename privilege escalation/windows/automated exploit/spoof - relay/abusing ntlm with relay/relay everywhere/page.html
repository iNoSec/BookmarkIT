</head><body>Using ntlmrelayx to relay NTLM everywhere<br/>
There are several tools available which abuse NTLM Authentication. One of those is smbrelayx, part of Core Securityâ€™s impacket library. Ntlmrelayx is an extension and partial rewrite of the smbrelayx tool, developed by Fox-IT. It features relaying to a wide range of protocols. The tool accepts multiple targets, cycling through each to find systems to authenticate to. The tool features an SMB and HTTP server, from which it can relay NTLM authentication to SMB, HTTP(s), IMAP, LDAP and MSSQL.<br/>
