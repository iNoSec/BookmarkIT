<title>Filename Upload Abuse</title>
</head><body><b>Filename</b><br/>
The filename itself may be being reflected in the page so it’s just a matter of naming the file with a XSS.<br/>
&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;.gif<br/>
<br/>
On Windows, these characters are typically not allowed, but you can name them with these characters using Alternate Data Streams:<br/>
<img src="image.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Metadata</b><br/>
Using the exiftool it’s possible to alter EXIF metadata which may lead to a reflection somewhere:<br/>
<br/>
$ exiftool -FIELD=XSS FILE<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
$ exiftool -Artist=’ “&gt;&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;’ brute.jpeg<br/>
<br/>
When the image is included/executed on a page, the XSS will present itself<br/>
<br/>
<b>Content</b><br/>
If the application allows the upload of a SVG file extension (which is also an image type), a file with the following content can be used to trigger a XSS:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; onload=&quot;alert(document.domain)&quot;/&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Source</b><br/>
It’s easy to build a GIF image to carry a javascript payload for use as a source of a script. This is useful to bypass the CSP (Content Security Policy) protection “script-src ‘self’ ” (which doesn’t allow &lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;, for example) if we are able to successfully inject in the same domain, as shown below.<br/>
<br/>
1. upload file<br/>
2. find exact location of img at website (ie, upload img.gif. check location www.site.com/images/img.gif)<br/>
3. attempt self xss (www.site.com/index.php?p=&lt;script src=site.com/images/img.gif&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To create such an image just use this as content and name it with .gif extension:<br/>
<br/>
GIF89a/*&lt;svg/onload=alert(1)&gt;*/=alert(document.domain)//;<br/>
<br/>
The signature of a GIF file, GIF89a, is used as a javascript variable assigned to the alert function. Between them however, there’s a commented XSS vector just in case the image can be retrieved as the text/HTML MIME type, thus allowing payload execution by just requesting the file.<br/>
<br/>
As we can also see below, the file UNIX-like command along with the PHP functions exif_imagetype() and getimagesize() recognize it as a GIF file. So if an application is using just these to validate the image, the file will be uploaded (but may be sanitized later).<br/>
