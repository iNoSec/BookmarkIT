</head><body>Some scheduled tasks have their action set as &quot;Custom Handler&quot;<br/>
You can view the action by pulling the XML<br/>
	schtasks /query /XML /TN &quot;\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\Automatic App Update&quot;<br/>

<br/>
There is a ComHandler associated with the task's action. This means that when the task runs, it reaches out to HKCR:\CLSID\{A6BA00FE-40E8-477C-B713-C64A14F18ADB}\I&lt;SubKey&gt;<br/>
and runs whatever DLL is specified<br/>

<br/>
Due to permissions, you can only hijack HKCU unless you have elevated privileges to hijack HKLM<br/>
By adding your key and it's subkey and adding our own DLL, the Scheduled Task will run whatever we put there.<br/>
<br/>
You can use Get-ScheduledTaskComHandler to see tasks you can potentially hijack<br/>
You can also specify tasks that are set to execute on logon by specifying -OnLogon<br/>
You can specify -PersistenceLocations to show only Scheduled Tasks that execute in userland AND start on logon</body></html>
