<br/>
edb is a cross platform x86/x86-64 debugger. It was inspired by Ollydbg, but aims to function on x86 and x86-64 as well as multiple OS's. Linux is the only officially supported platform at the moment, but FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX and Windows ports are underway with varying degrees of functionality.<br/>

edb is available under the GPL 2 license, see the COPYING for details.<br/>

Cloning<br/>
When cloning the repo, please use git's --recursive flag to ensure that the sub-modules will be properly cloned and updated to the correct versions. Here is an example:<br/>
<br/>
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger.git<br/>
<br/>
Compiling<br/>
Compiling edb is generally quite simple. edb currently depends on the following packages:<br/>
<br/>
Dependency	Version Required<br/>
Qt	&gt;= 4.6<br/>
Boost (Headers Only)	&gt;= 1.35<br/>
Capstone	&gt;= 3.0<br/>
Graphviz	&gt;= 2.38.0 (Optional)<br/>
Many distributions already have packages that satisify these. The wiki contains examples for some popular distributions:<br/>

https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/wiki/Compiling-(Fedora)<br/>
https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/wiki/Compiling-(Ubuntu)<br/>
https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/wiki/Compiling-(Debian)<br/>
Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, compilation is done with cmake:<br/>
<br/>
CMake<br/>
If you plan to just run edb out of the build directory, it's as simple as this:<br/>
<br/>
$ mkdir build<br/>
$ cd build<br/>
$ cmake ..<br/>
$ make<br/>
$ ./edb<br/>
If you would like to properly install edb on the system for all users, it's only a little different:<br/>
<br/>
$ mkdir build<br/>
$ cd build<br/>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ ..<br/>
$ make<br/>
$ make install<br/>
$ edb<br/>
Installing<br/>
Basic installation is simple, you may run<br/>
<br/>
$ make install<br/>
In which case the plugins will be installed in /usr/local/lib/edb and the binaries will be installed in /usr/local/bin/.</body></html>
