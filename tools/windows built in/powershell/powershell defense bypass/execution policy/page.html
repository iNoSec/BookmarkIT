</head><body>Execute scripts<br/>
<br/>
So for security reasons the default policy for executing scripts is Restricted. Here are the different script-policies.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Restricted</b>: PowerShell won't run any scripts. This is PowerShell's default execution policy.<br/>
<b>AllSigned</b>: PowerShell will only run scripts that are signed with a digital signature. If you run a script signed by a publisher PowerShell hasn't seen before, PowerShell will ask whether you trust the script's publisher.<br/>
<b>RemoteSigned</b>: PowerShell won't run scripts downloaded from the Internet unless they have a digital signature, but scripts not downloaded from the Internet will run without prompting. If a script has a digital signature, PowerShell will prompt you before it runs a script from a publisher it hasn't seen before.<br/>
<b>Unrestricted</b>: PowerShell ignores digital signatures but will still prompt you before running a script downloaded from the Internet.<br/>
