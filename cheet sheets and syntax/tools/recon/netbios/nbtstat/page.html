<title>NbtStat</title>
</head><body>The nbtstat command removes and corrects preloaded entries using a number of case-sensitive switches. The nbtstat - a &lt;name&gt;** command performs a NetBIOS adapter status command on the computer name specified by &lt; name&gt; . The adapter status command returns the local NetBIOS name table for that computer as well as the MAC address of the adapter card. The <b>nbtstat -A &lt; IP address &gt;</b>command performs the same function using a target IP address rather than a name.<br/>
<br/>
The <b>nbtstat - c</b>option shows the contents of the NetBIOS name cache, which contains NetBIOS name-to-IP address mappings.<br/>
<br/>
<b>nbtstat -n</b>displays the names that have been registered locally on the system by NetBIOS applications such as the server and redirector.<br/>
<br/>
The <b>nbtstat -r</b>command displays the count of all NetBIOS names resolved by broadcast and by querying a WINS server. The nbtstat -R command purges the name cache and reloads all #PRE entries from the LMHOSTS file. #PRE entries are the LMHOSTS name entries that are preloaded into the cache. For more information about the LMHOSTS file, see the appendix &quot;LMHOSTS Files&quot; in this book.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Nbtstat -RR</b>sends name release packets to the WINS server and starts a refresh, thus re-registering all names with the name server without having to reboot. This is a new option in Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 as well as in Windows 2000.<br/>
<br/>
You can use <b>nbtstat -S</b>to list the current NetBIOS sessions and their status, including statistics<br/>
<br/>
Table 3.4 Nbtstat Switches<br/>
Switch			Name		Function<br/>
-a &lt; name &gt;		adapter status	Returns the NetBIOS name table and MAC address of the address card for the computer name specified.<br/>
-A &lt; IP address &gt;	Adapter status	Lists the same information as -a when given the target's IP address.<br/>
-c				cache		Lists the contents of the NetBIOS name cache.<br/>
[ Number ]		Interval		Typing a numerical value tells Nbtstat to redisplay selected statistics each interval seconds, pausing between each display. Press Ctrl+C to stop redisplaying statistics.<br/>
-n				names		Displays the names registered locally by NetBIOS applications such as the server and redirector.<br/>
-r				resolved		Displays a count of all names resolved by broadcast or WINS server.<br/>
-R				Reload		Purges the name cache and reloads all #PRE entries from LMHOSTS.<br/>
-RR				ReleaseRefresh	Releases and reregisters all names with the name server.<br/>
-s				sessions		Lists the NetBIOS sessions table converting destination IP addresses to computer NetBIOS names.<br/>
-S				Sessions		Lists the current NetBIOS sessions and their status, with the IP address.<br/>
