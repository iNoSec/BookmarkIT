<title>Encrypting Malware</title>
</head><body>In order to obfuscate our malware we can encrypt it, and thus radically changing the signature. One much mentioned tool for doing that is Hyperion. It is a windows binary but we can compile and run it from linux as well. This worked for me (october 2016)<br/>
<br/>
wget https://github.com/nullsecuritynet/tools/raw/master/binary/hyperion/release/Hyperion-1.2.zip<br/>
unzip Hyperion-1.2.zip<br/>
i686-w64-mingw32-c++ Hyperion-1.2/Src/Crypter/*.cpp -o hyperion.exe<br/>
<br/>
In Kali you have hyperion 1 included. However for it to work you have to run it from it's correct path. So go to /usr/share/veil-evasion/tools/hyperion<br/>
<br/>
And run it like this<br/>
wine hyperion /path/to/file.exe encryptedfile.exe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look for other options</body></html>
