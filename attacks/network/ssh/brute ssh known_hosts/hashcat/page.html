<title>Hashcat</title>
</head><body>Fortunately, hashcat can do HMAC SHA1 attack so now it is only a matter of converting hash from base64 to hex. <br/>
<br/>
The following code converts .known_hosts file to hashcat format, which is hash:salt<br/>
<br/>
gcc hexhosts.c -lresolv -w -o hexhosts<br/>
./hexhosts 							#(looks like it opens known_hosts in binary's directory)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are now ready to do some hash cracking. Put the output of hexhosts in a file, call it hash.txt<br/>
<br/>
hashcat does support attack masks, here is one to match all IPv4 addresses(mask by undeath, hashcat forum)<br/>
<br/>
ipv4.hcmask http://pastebin.com/4HQ6C8gG<br/>
<br/>
All set!<br/>
<br/>
./hashcat-cli64.bin -a 3 -m 160 hash.txt ipv4.hcmask --hex-salt<br/>
On a dual-core i7 3537U CPU it took only 4 minutes to crack<br/>
<br/>
We can get even more speed if we use GPU. To fully utilize GPU power we need a different approach to the attack mode. oclHashcat, unlike hashcat, supports multiple wordlists and tries combinations of words in them. <br/>
(original idea https://www.phillips321.co.uk/2012/04/04/cracking-an-md5-of-an-ip-address/) <br/>
<br/>
first wordlist (ips-left.txt) is for the first two octets of address.<br/>
second wordlist (ips-right.txt) is for the last two.<br/>
<br/>
ip-gen.sh<br/>
<br/>
Cracking using GPU<br/>
<br/>
oclHashcat64.bin -m 160 -a 1 hash.txt ips-left.txt ips-right.txt --hex-salt<br/>
I have set up a git repo with stuff<br/>
