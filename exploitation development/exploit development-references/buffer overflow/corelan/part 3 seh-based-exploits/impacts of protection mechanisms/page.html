<title>Impacts of Protection Mechanisms</title>
</head><body><b>XOR</b><br/>
In order to be able to build an exploit based on SEH overwrite, we will need to make a distinction between Windows XP pre-SP1 and SP1 and up. Since Windows XP SP1, before the exception handler is called, all registers are XORed with each other, making them all contain 0x00000000, which means you won’t be able to find a reference to your payload in one of the registers. In other words, maybe you’ll see that one or more registers point at your payload at the first chance exception, but when the EH kicks in, these registers are cleared again (so you cannot jump to them directly in order to execute your shellcode). We’ll talk about this later on.<br/>
<br/>
<b>DEP &amp; Stack Cookies</b><br/>
On top of that, Stack Cookies (via C++ compiler options) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) were introduced (Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003) . I will write an entire post on Stack cookies and DEP. In sort, you only need to remember that these two techniques can make it significantly harder to build exploits.<br/>
<br/>
<b>SafeSEH</b><br/>
Some additional protection was added to compilers, helping to stop the abuse of SEH overwrites. This protection mechanism is active for all modules that are compiled with /safeSEH<br/>
<br/>
<b>Windows 2003</b><br/>
Under Windows 2003 server, more protection was added. I’m not going to discuss these protections in this post (check tutorial series part 6 for more info), because things would start to get too complex at this point. As soon as you mastered this tutorial, you will be ready to look at tutorial part 6 :-)</body></html>
