<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>In most AD implementations, there is at least one GPO configured on the domain defining mandated password, Kerberos, and domain-wide policies; at least one GPO configured for the Domain Controllers OUl and at least one GPO configured for a servers and workstations OU. <br/>
GPOs only apply to users and computers and can be filtered with groups or more specifically targeted using the Preferences component. The &quot;No Override&quot; option ensures that the settings in a Group Policy are applied even if a GPO closer to the resource has contradicting settings. <br/>
<br/>
Two Group Policy components:<br/>
	<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759367%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">Group Policy Container</a>is stored in Active Directory (&lt;DOMAIN&gt;, System, Policies)<br/>
	The files that actually contain the policy settings (collectively referred to as the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759367%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">Group Policy Template</a>) are stored in SYSVOL. All domain Group Policies are stored in the following domain share: \\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\SYSVOL\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\Policies\<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each Group Policy Object in Active Directory has the following attributes (on the policy object in AD):<br/>
<ul><li>displayName: This is the name given to the GPO by the creator.</li>
<li>gPCFileSysPath: This points to the location in SYSVOL where the associated GPO files (aka “Group Policy Template”) are located.</li>
<li>gPCMachineExtensionNames: This attribute lists the GPO client side extensions (CSEs) required to by the client process the machine specific Group Policy settings.</li>
<li>gPCUserExtensionNames: This attribute lists the GPO client side extensions (CSEs) required to by the client process the user specific Group Policy settings.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Note that the GPO is tracked in AD via the GPO GUID which has a separate AD object GUID for the AD object. There are a few different reasons for this, and one of the key reasons is to ensure there are predictable GUIDs for specific Group Policy Objects regardless of the Active Directory instance. The “Default Domain Policy” GPO’s GUID is “31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9” and the “Default Domain Controller Policy ” GPO’s GUID is “6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9” by default.<br/>

<b>Group Policy Management</b><br/>
Group Policy management is often delegated in large enterprises so several different organizations are able to create, modify, and delete Group Policies. This issue with this is that Group Policy quickly gets unruly and difficult to manage since many more than the originally designed (and selected) admins have GPO admin rights. These rights are often delegated at the domain level, so edit (or full) rights apply to all domain GPOs, even those that apply to the Domain (everything) and/or Domain Controllers.<br/>
<br/>
The Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) is the primary tool for Group Policy administration and there’s a PowerShell module (GroupPolicy) which is extremely useful for reporting on and backing up GPOs (please backup the domain GPOs regularly) using <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee461052.aspx">Backup-GPO</a>.<br/>
