Since the eJPT is $399 for 60 days of lab time and you can learn at your own pace, I figured it was a small investment to see if this was something I really wanted to pursue.<br/>
<br/>
The course content was great, it was set up with slides and videos as an online classroom, and there are forums where you can ask the instructor questions. The thing I like about eLearnSecurity most of all is the labs are dedicated to you, where no one can revert your machines on you while you're working on them. cough OSCP and HackTheBox cough<br/>
<br/>
Next I moved on to eCPPT, even though I didn't use all my lab time in eJPT I signed up for 120 hours of lab time for $1299.<br/>
<br/>
It was much more difficult than eJPT, not necessarily because the content was harder, but just because of the sheer volume. There are 14 hours of video training material, over 5500 slides, and 27 labs in Hera Lab.</body></html>
