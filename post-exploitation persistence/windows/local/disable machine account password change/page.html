<title>Disable Machine Account Password Change</title>
</head><body>If you can recover a machine's account hash (ends with $), you can create silver tickets that grant admin access to the machine as long as the hash does not change. By default, machine rotate their machine account passwords every 30 days. It's up to the machine to rotate its own password, we can disable this behavior and retain indefinite access to a machine. <br/>

It sets<br/>
HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DisablePasswordChange to 1<br/>
which prevents the system from changing it's account password</body></html>
