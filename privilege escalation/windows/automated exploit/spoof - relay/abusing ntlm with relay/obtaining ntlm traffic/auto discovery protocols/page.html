</head><body>Auto Discovery protocols<br/>
Perhaps the most infamous feature among hackers for the past years was the Windows Proxy Auto Detection (WPAD) feature. This feature would essentially look for a hostname called WPAD, via DNS and if not successful via LLMNR and NBNS as described above, and then connect to the first host it could find. Abusing this feature was made even easier because when prompted for authentication, workstations would automatically attempt to authenticate with NTLM Authentication, which could then be relayed by an attacker. Several aspects of this have been patched by Microsoft in June 2016, but at times Fox-IT still encounters this in networks.</body></html>
