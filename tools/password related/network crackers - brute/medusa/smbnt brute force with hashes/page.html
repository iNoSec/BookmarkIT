</head><body>A unique feature of medusa is the ability to take hashes and test them against netbios (139) and microsoft-ds (445) services. <br/>
The SMBNT module allows Medusa to directly test NTLM hashes against a Windows Host. <br/>
<br/>
Be careful of mass domain account lockout with this module. For example, assume you are checking several accounts against many domain workstations. If you are using either the &quot;GROUP:DOMAIN&quot; or the &quot;GROUP:BOTH&quot; option and these accounts do not exist locally on the workstations, each workstation will in turn check their respective domain controller. This could cause a bunch of lockouts. <br/>
<br/>
FYI, this code is unable to test accounts on default XP hosts which are not part of a domain and do not have normal file sharing enabled. Default XP does not allow shares and returns STATUS_LOGON_FAILED for both valid and invalid credentials. XP with simple sharing enabled returns SUCCESS for both valid and invalid credentials. </body></html>
