<title>Tyranid's Token Impersonation</title>
</head><body>For Windows 10 full bypass is as follows:<ul><li>Capture the admin token and create a restricted version which is no longer elevated.</li>
<li>Impersonate the token and get a system service to create a new process using that token. This results in a low-privilege new process which happens to be in the non-limited logon session.</li>
<li>Capture the original full privileged admin token in the new process and impersonate, as our logon session doesn't have the <i>LIMITED_LOGON_SESSION </i>flag the impersonation check passes and we've got full privilege again.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Versions of Windows earlier than 10 don't check for LIMITED_LOGON_SESSION so it's a bit easier<br/>
This bypass should work on Vista+</body></html>
