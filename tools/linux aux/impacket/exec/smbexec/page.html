<title>Smbexec</title>
</head><body>The Service File Name contains a command string to execute (%COMSPEC% points to the absolute path of cmd.exe). It echos the command to be executed to a bat file, redirects the stdout and stderr to a Temp file, then executes the bat file and deletes it. Back on Kali, the Python script then pulls the output file via SMB and displays the contents in our &quot;pseudo-shell&quot;. For every command we type into our &quot;shell&quot;, a new service is created and the process is repeated. This is why it doesn't need to drop a binary, it just executes each desired command as a new service. Definitely more stealthy, but as we saw, an event log is created for every command executed. Still a very clever way to get a non-interactive &quot;shell&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
smbexec.py<br/>
<br/>
A similar approach to psexec w/o using RemComSvc. The technique is described here http://blog.accuvant.com/rdavisaccuvant/owning-computers-without-shell-access/.<br/>
Our implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local smbserver to receive the output of the commands. This is useful in the situation where the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available.<br/>
<br/>
# This script works in two ways:<br/>
# 1) share mode: you specify a share, and everything is done through that share.<br/>
# 2) server mode: if for any reason there's no share available, this script will launch a local<br/>
#  SMB server, so the output of the commands executed are sent back by the target machine<br/>
#  into a locally shared folder. Keep in mind you would need root access to bind to port 445 <br/>
#  in the local machine.<br/>

usage: smbexec.py [-h] [-share SHARE] [-mode {SHARE,SERVER}] [-debug]<br/>
         [-dc-ip ip address] [-target-ip ip address]<br/>
         [-port [destination port]] [-hashes LMHASH:NTHASH]<br/>
         [-no-pass] [-k] [-aesKey hex key]<br/>
         target<br/>
<br/>
positional arguments:<br/>
 target        [[domain/]username[:password]@]&lt;targetName or address&gt;<br/>
<br/>
optional arguments:<br/>
 -h, --help      show this help message and exit<br/>
 -share SHARE     share where the output will be grabbed from (default<br/>
            C$)<br/>
 -mode {SHARE,SERVER} mode to use (default SHARE, SERVER needs root!)<br/>
 -debug        Turn DEBUG output ON<br/>
<br/>
connection:<br/>
 -dc-ip ip address   IP Address of the domain controller. If omitted it<br/>
            will use the domain part (FQDN) specified in the<br/>
            target parameter<br/>
 -target-ip ip address<br/>
            IP Address of the target machine. If ommited it will<br/>
            use whatever was specified as target. This is useful<br/>
            when target is the NetBIOS name and you cannot resolve<br/>
            it<br/>
 -port [destination port]<br/>
            Destination port to connect to SMB Server<br/>
<br/>
authentication:<br/>
 -hashes LMHASH:NTHASH<br/>
            NTLM hashes, format is LMHASH:NTHASH<br/>
 -no-pass       don't ask for password (useful for -k)<br/>
 -k          Use Kerberos authentication. Grabs credentials from<br/>
            ccache file (KRB5CCNAME) based on target parameters.<br/>
            If valid credentials cannot be found, it will use the<br/>
            ones specified in the command line<br/>
 -aesKey hex key    AES key to use for Kerberos Authentication (128 or 256<br/>
            bits)<br/>
