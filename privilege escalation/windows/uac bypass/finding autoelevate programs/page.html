<title>Finding AutoElevate Programs</title>
</head><body>The default UAC setting will not prompt the user when some built-in Windows programs try to elevate themselves. More practically, this means that some built-in Windows programs always run in a high integrity context.<br/>
<br/>
These programs that automatically elevate have a few properties. <ul><li>They are signed with Microsoft’s code signing certificate. </li>
<li>They are located in a “secure” folder (e.g., c:\windows\system32). </li>
<li>They request the right to autoElevate in their manifest.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
We can find which programs autoElevate themselves with a little strings magic:<br/>
<br/>
cd c:\windows\<br/>
strings –s *.exe | findstr /i autoelevate<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For Windows 7 RC, here is a list of exec that have the AutoElevate privilege (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141127035941/http://www.withinwindows.com/2009/05/02/short-windows-7-release-candidate-auto-elevate-white-list/">Archive:WithinWindows</a>)</body></html>
