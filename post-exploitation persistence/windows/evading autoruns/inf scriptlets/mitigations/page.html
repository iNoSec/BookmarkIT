<title>Mitigations</title>
</head><body>Defensive Considerations<ul><li>The same defensive considerations presented in Part 1 are still applicable.  Remember that INF attributes (directives, header names, etc.) and file names can be changed for deceptive purposes.</li>
<li>From a monitoring perspective, dive deep into “AutoRuns Analysis” and keep an eye out for misplaced binaries (i.e. The “Fish out of water” case).  Just because a binary is signed does not mean it is benign.  Focus on directory paths in addition to those funny looking command switches/arguments.</li>
<li>Enforce Application Whitelisting (AWL) policies.  Move beyond default rules, and tighten up weak directory permissions in sensitive file structures.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/InvalidOperator">@InvalidOperator</a> pointed out that IExpress binaries may write to Run or RunOnce keys on execution.  This could potentially be useful for IOC monitoring.</li>
