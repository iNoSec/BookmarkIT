[<a href="https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow">tcpflow</a>]() | tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis and debugging. Each TCP flow is stored in its own file. Thus, the typical TCP flow will be stored in two files, one for each direction. tcpflow can also process stored 'tcpdump' packet flows.<br/>
[<a href="https://github.com/blendin/3snake">3snake</a>]() | Targeting rooted servers, reads memory from sshd and sudo system calls that handle password based authentication. Doesn't write any memory to the traced processes. Spawns a new process for every sshd and sudo command that is run. Listens for the proc event using netlink sockets to get candidate processes to trace. When it receives an sshd or sudo process ptrace is attached and traces read and write system calls, extracting strings related to password based authentication.<br/>
