<title>Graph Drawing Area</title>
</head><body>This is the area where BloodHound will draw nodes and edges. Hitting ctrl will cycle through three options for displaying node labels: Default Threshold, Always Show, Never Show. You may click and hold a node to drag it to a different spot. You may also click a node, and BloodHound will populate the node info tab with information about that node.</body></html>
