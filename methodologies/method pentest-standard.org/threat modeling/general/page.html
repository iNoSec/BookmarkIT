This section defines a threat modeling approach as required for a correct execution of a penetration testing. The standard does not use a specific model, but instead requires that the model used be consistent in terms of its representation of threats, their capabilities, their qualifications as per the organization being tested, and the ability to repeatedly be applied to future tests with the same results.<br/>
<br/>
The standard focuses on two key elements of traditional threat modeling - assets and attacker (threat community/agent). Each one is respectively broken down into business assets and business processes and the threat communities and their capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
As a minimum, all four elements should be clearly identified and documented in every penetration test.<br/>
<br/>
When modeling the attacker side, on top of the threat community (which is mostly semantic and can be tied back to the organization’s business SWOT analysis), and the capabilities (which is mostly technical), additional aspects of motivation modeling should also be provided. These additional points essentially take into account the value of the different assets available at the target and are combined with the cost of acquiring it.<br/>
As a complementary model, impact modeling should also be performed for the organization in order to provide a more accurate view of the “what-if?” scenario surrounding the loss event of each of the identified assets. This should take into account the assets “net” value, its intrinsic value, and other indirectly incurred costs associated with a loss event.<br/>
<br/>
The threat modeling phase of any penetration testing engagement is critical for both the testers, as well as the organization. It provides clarity as far as the organization’s risk appetite and prioritization (which assets are more important than others? what threat communities are more relevant than others?). Additionally, it enables the tester to focus on delivering an engagement that closely emulates the tools, techniques, capabilities, accessibility and general profile of the attacker, while keeping in mind what are the actual targets inside the organization such that the more relevant controls, processes, and infrastructure are put to the test rather than an inventory list of IT elements.<br/>
The threat model should be constructed in coordination with the organization being tested whenever possible, and even in a complete black-box situation where the tester does not have any prior information on the organization, the tester should create a threat model based on the attacker’s view in combination with OSINT related to the target organization.<br/>
<br/>
The model should be clearly documented, and be delivered as part of the final report as the findings in the report will reference the threat model in order to create a more accurate relevance and risk score that is specific to the organization (rather than a generic technical one).</body></html>
