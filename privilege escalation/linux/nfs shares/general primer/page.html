Network File System<br/>
Allows a system to share file system resources over a network<br/>
Using client-server architecture<br/>
The client imports the file system resources that were exported by the server<br/>
Bases its access control to files on the server's file system, on the UID and GID provided by the client (RPC requests)<br/>
<br/>
Root Squashing<br/>
Mapping files owned by root (uid 0) to a different id (anonymous or nobody uid)<br/>
<br/>
Root Squash defined by default<br/>
Exporting with the no_root_squash option is dangerous!</body></html>
