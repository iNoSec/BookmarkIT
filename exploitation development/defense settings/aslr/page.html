<title>ASLR</title>
</head><body>Linux kernel 2.6.8 by default doesn't have ASRL (ASLR got added into the Linux kernel by default from 2.6.12 onwards), therefore the attacker doesn't have to worry about ASLR<br/>
<br/>
In linux, ASLR is typically set in proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space with value of 1. You can turn it off if you have permissions:<br/>
# echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</body></html>
