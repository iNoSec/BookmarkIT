</head><body>Named Pipes are one of the methods used to perform IPC in Windows<br/>
One-way or duplex pipe communications between pipe server and one or more pipe clients<br/>
Utilizes a unique files system called NPFS (Named Pipe Filysystem)<br/>
Any process can access named pipes, subject to security checks<br/>
All instances of a named pipe share the same pipe name, but each instance has its own buffers and handles<br/>
<br/>
Many configurations<br/>
Half duplex, full duplex<br/>
Byte-oriented, packet-oriented<br/>
Local or Network!<br/>
<br/>
Named pipes network communication is NOT encrypted and uses the protocols SMB (445) or DCE/RPC (135)<br/>
<br/>
Named and Unnamed \ anonymous Pipes<br/>
Two types of named pipes:<br/>
• Named pipes: have a specific name, all instances share the name<br/>
• Unnamed \ anonymous pipe: is not given a name<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">o Only used for communication between a child and it’s parent process</li>
</ul>
<ul>o Always local; they cannot be used for communication over a network</ul>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">o Vanishes as soon as it is closed, or one of the process (parent or child) completes execution</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">o Actually named pipes with a random name</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Named pipes have Access Control Lists<br/>
By default DACL (discretionary access control lists) permissions are set to <b>everyone</b>using <b>anonymous login</b>(null session)<br/>
There is a max number of instances of a pipe<br/>
