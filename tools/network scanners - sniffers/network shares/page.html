<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-shares.html">Nmap NSE - smb-enum-shares</a>| Attempts to list shares using the srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll MSRPC function and retrieve more information about them using srvsvc.NetShareGetInfo. If access to those functions is denied, a list of common share names are checked. Running NetShareEnumAll will work anonymously against Windows 2000, and requires a user-level account on any other Windows version. Calling NetShareGetInfo requires an administrator account on all versions of Windows up to 2003, as well as Windows Vista and Windows 7, if UAC is turned down. Even if NetShareEnumAll is restricted, attempting to connect to a share will always reveal its existence. So, if NetShareEnumAll fails, a pre-generated list of shares, based on a large test network, are used. If any of those succeed, they are recorded.<br/>
