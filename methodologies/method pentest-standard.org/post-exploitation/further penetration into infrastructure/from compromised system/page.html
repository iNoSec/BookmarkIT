Actions that can be taken from a compromised system:<br/>
*Upload tools<br/>
*Use local system tools<br/>
*ARP Scan<br/>
*Ping Sweep<br/>
*DNS Enumeration of internal network<br/>
*Directory Services Enumeration<br/>
*Brute force attacks<br/>
*Enumeration and Management thru Management Protocols and compromised credentials (WinRM, WMI, SMB, SNMP..etc)<br/>
*Abuse of compromised credentials and keys (Webpages, Databases..etc)<br/>
*Execute Remote Exploits<br/>
The action that will be executed will depend on the information needed to show specific risk and/or further penetrating the client's network and hosts. Regular planning sessions are recommended to re-evaluate the information gather and decide the best approach to continue the post exploitation until the set goals are meet.<br/>
