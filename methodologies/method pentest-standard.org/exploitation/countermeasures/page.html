<title>Countermeasures</title>
</head><body>== Countermeasures ==<br/>
<br/>
Countermeasures are defined as preventative technology or controls that hinder the ability to successfully complete an exploit avenue. This technology could be a Host Based Intrusion Prevention System, Security Guard, Web Application Firewall, or other preventative methods. When performing an exploit, several factors should be taken into consideration. In the event of a preventative technology, a circumvention technique should be considered. In circumstances when this is not possible, alternative exploit methods should be considered.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the purpose is to remain stealth when attacking the organization, if alarms are tripped the level of the assessment could be diminished. If at all possible, the countermeasures should be enumerated prior to triggering the exploit. This could be done through doing dry runs of the attack or enumerating the technology. </body></html>
