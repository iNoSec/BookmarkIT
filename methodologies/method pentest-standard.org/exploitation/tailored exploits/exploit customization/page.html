In the event of an attack, it is often required to simulate the victims infrastructure in order to ensure that the exploitation phase will be successful. The techniques leveraged in the information gathering phase can always help assist in that however, having a working infrastructure and systems in place will make the expliotation phase much easier. In the event of a tailored exploit, the penetration tester should be able to customize already public exploits in order to successfully attack a system. A common theme for exploits is to target specific versions of operating systems or applications. The reason for this is due to memory addresses changing based on service packs, and/or new versions of the operating system. The tester should be able to customize these exploits to successfully deploy to different operating systems and successfully compromise the syste</body></html>
