There are 3 steps in the NTLM Authentication protocol:<br/>
<br/>
Negotiate authentication: The first step of NTLM authentication is the negotiation of the protocol, and which features are supported by the client. In this stage, the client sends the request for authentication to the server, including the NTLM versions accepted by the client.<br/>
<br/>
Server challenge: The server responds with its own message, indicating which NTLM versions it accepts and which features it wants to use. This message also includes a “challenge” value, which is important in the authentication.<br/>
<br/>
Authentication response: The client sends back the response based on the challenge, and includes the username and domain to which the password belongs.<br/>
<br/>
After the 3 messages are exchanged, the server replies with either a message indicating that the authentication was successful, or that the authentication failed. Depending on which protocol is used, the session the client has with the server is now authenticated. This process is displayed in the figure below:<br/>
