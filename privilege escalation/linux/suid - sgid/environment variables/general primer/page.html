</head><body>Environment Variables<br/>
Memory objects that can be referred to by one or more applications<br/>
$PATH stores file system paths that are used by the shell to search for executables in respective order of the defined paths<br/>
system() - executes a command by calling /bin/sh -c command, and returns after the command has been completed<br/>
Additional C functions that may use the $PATH<br/>
	popen()<br/>
	execlp()<br/>
	execvp()<br/>
	execvpe()<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Absolute Paths<br/>
Not always a mitigating factor!<br/>
Depending on shell (bash / dash / etc), it can still be exploited<br/>
Bash &lt; 4.2-048 could pass to executables functions that are named similar to an absolute path<br/>
Bash supports a script debugging mode<br/>
Bash uses the PS4 environment variable to define a prompt for debugging mode<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can obtain write access to the full path location anyway!<br/>
