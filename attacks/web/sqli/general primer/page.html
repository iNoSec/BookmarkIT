</head><body><b>Quick Explanation:</b><br/>
As the name suggests, an SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious input into an SQL statement. <br/>
<br/>
For example, let's say functionality in the web application generates a string with the following SQL statement:<br/>
<br/>
$statement = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'bob' AND password = 'mysecretpw'&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
Now consider the following example in which a website user is able to change the values of '$user' and '$password', such as in a login form:<br/>
<br/>
$statement = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$user' AND password = '$password'&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
An attacker can easily insert any special SQL syntax inside the statement, if the input is not sanitized by the application:<br/>
<br/>
$statement = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'; -- ' AND password = 'anything'&quot;; = 'anything'&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
This SQL injection effectively removes the password verification, and returns a dataset for an existing user â€“ 'admin' in this case. The attacker can now log in with an administrator account, without having to specify a password.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Different Types of SQLi</b>:<br/>
Error-Based SQL Injection<br/>
Boolean-Based SQL Injection <br/>
Time-Based<br/>
Out-of-Band<br/>
<br/>
<b>Impacts of SQL Injection<br/>
</b>There are a number of things an attacker can do when exploiting an SQL injection on a vulnerable website. Usually, it depends on the privileges of the user the web application uses to connect to the database server. By exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can:<br/>
<br/>
Add, delete, edit or read content in the database<br/>
Read source code from files on the database server<br/>
Write files to the database server</body></html>
