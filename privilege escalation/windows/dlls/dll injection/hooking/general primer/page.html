Hooking covers a range of techniques used to alter or augment the behaviour of an operating system, of applications, or of other software components by intercepting function calls or messages or events passed between software components. Code that handles such intercepted functions calls, events, or messages is called a &quot;hook&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Hooking is the most powerful technique available in computer software. A person can do almost everything on a system by applying hooks on the right locations. <br/>
<br/>
As stated in the definition, we intercept function calls or messages or events. Because it is taking the advantage of flow of execution, we can apply hooks on multiple locations from original file to system calls. <br/>
<br/>
Primarily Hooks can be divided into two parts: <ul><li>User mode hooks</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>IAT (Import Address Table) Hooking</li>
<li>Inline Hooking</li>
<li>Call Patching in binary etc..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kernel Mode hooks</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>IDT Hooking</li>
<li>SSDT Hooking etc..</li>
</ul>
