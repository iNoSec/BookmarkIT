<title>AT</title>
</head><body>The Windows AT command is sort of a second rate citizen compared to schtasks. It can also schedule tasks to run at specific times but does not have nearly as many configuration options.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to keep in mind is that the AT command always runs with SYSTEM level privileges. Several usage examples can be seen below.<br/>
<br/>
# Runs a batch file daily at 8am.<br/>
at 08:00 /EVERY:m,t,w,th,f,s,su C:\Some\Evil\batch.bat<br/>
<br/>
# Runs a binary every Tuesday at 8am.<br/>
at 08:00 /EVERY:t C:\Some\Evil\Task.exe<br/>
<br/>
# Runs a binary, only once, at 10pm.<br/>
at 22:00 /NEXT: C:\Some\Evil\Task.exe<br/>
<br/>
# Runs a task on a remote machine, every 1st and 20th of the month, at 8am.<br/>
