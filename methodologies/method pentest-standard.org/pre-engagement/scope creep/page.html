<title>Scope Creep</title>
</head><body>Scope Creep<br/>
Scope creep is one of the most efficient ways to put a penetration testing firm out of business. The issue is that many companies and managers have little to no idea how to identify it, or how to react to it when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things to remember when battling scope creep. First, if a customer is pleased with the work done on a particular engagement, it is very common for them to request additional work. Take this as a compliment, and do not hesitate to ask for additional funding to compensate for the extra time spent. If a customer refuses to pay for the extra work, it is almost never worth staying on to do that work.<br/>
<br/>
The second point is even more critical. When dealing with existing customers, take care to keep the prices lower. Taking advantage of a good situation by price gouging is a sure way to drive away repeat business. Take into consideration that prices can be lowered since the firm avoided the costs of acquiring the customer such as the formal RFP process and hunting for the customer itself. Further, the best source for future work is through existing customers. Treat them well and they will return.</body></html>
