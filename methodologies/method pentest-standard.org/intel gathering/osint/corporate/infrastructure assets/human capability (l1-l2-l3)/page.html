</head><body>==== Human capability (L1/L2/L3) ====<br/>
Discovering the defensive human capability of a target organization can be difficult. There are several key pieces of information that could assist in judging the security of the target organization.<br/>
<br/>
* Check for the presence of a company-wide CERT/CSIRT/PSRT team<br/>
* Check for advertised jobs to see how often a security position is listed<br/>
* Check for advertised jobs to see if security is listed as a requirement for non-security jobs (e.g. developers)<br/>
* Check for out-sourcing agreements to see if the security of the target has been outsourced partially or in it's entirety<br/>
* Check for specific individuals working for the company that may be active in the security community</body></html>
