</head><body><b>General OSCP Thoughts</b><ul><li>Know what you're getting yourself into, took me 292 days full-time</li>
<li>This is not a “I’ll study on weekends” cert</li>
<li>I have no idea how people do this with a full-time job or have a wife ands kids</li>
<li>Expect late nights/early mornings, lunch breaks, 4-16 hour days</li>
<li>Your significant other and friends and family are going to be pissed</li>
<li>What’s a social life?</li>
<li>Be comfortable with python and scripting, general networking, and sysadmin tasks</li>
<li>Get ready to rage, Offsec are known to be trolls. Their motto is “try harder”</li>
</ul>
HackTheBox is the closest lab I've found that are similar to the OSCP lab environment, with some of the machines having similar solutions. (Also shoutout to pentesterlab and vulnhub)<ul><li>But if you don’t lose your cool you’ll come out at the other end; at one point things just clicked</li>
</ul>
