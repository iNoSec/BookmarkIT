<title>Forward/Reverse DNS</title>
</head><body>==== Forward/Reverse DNS ====<br/>
Reverse DNS can be used to obtain valid server names in use within an organizational. There is a caveat that it must have a PTR (reverse) DNS record for it to resolve a name from a provided IP address. If it does resolve then the results are returned. This is usually performed by testing the server with various IP addresses to see if it returns any results.</body></html>
