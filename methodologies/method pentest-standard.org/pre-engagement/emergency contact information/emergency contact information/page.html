<title>Emergency Contact Information</title>
</head><body>Emergency Contact Information<br/>
Obviously, being able to get in touch with the customer or target organization in an emergency is vital. Emergencies may arise, and a point of contact must have been established in order to handle them. Create an emergency contact list. This list should include contact information for all parties in the scope of testing. Once created, the emergency contact list should be shared with all those on the list. Keep in mind, the target organization may not be the customer.<br/>
<br/>
Gather the following information about each emergency contact:<br/>
<br/>
Full name<br/>
Title and operational responsibility<br/>
Authorization to discuss details of the testing activities, if not already specified<br/>
Two forms of 24/7 immediate contact, such as cell phone, pager, or home phone, if possible<br/>
One form of secure bulk data transfer, such as SFTP or encrypted email<br/>
Note: The number for a group such as the help desk or operations center can replace one emergency contact, but only if it is staffed 24/7. The nature of each penetration test influences who should be on the emergency contact list. Not only will contact information for the customer and targets need to be made available, but they may also need to contact the testers in an emergency. The list should preferably include the following people:<br/>
<br/>
All penetration testers in the test group for the engagement<br/>
The manager of the test group<br/>
Two technical contacts at each target organization<br/>
Two technical contacts at the customer<br/>
One upper management or business contact at the customer<br/>
It is possible that there will be some overlap in the above list. For instance, the target organization may be the customer, the test group’s manager may also be performing the penetration test, or a customer’s technical contact may be in upper management. It is also recommended to define a single contact person per involved party who leads it and takes responsibility on behalf of it.</body></html>
