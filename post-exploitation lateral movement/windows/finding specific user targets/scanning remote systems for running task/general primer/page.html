</head><body>Once you are running as the shared local administrator account on a domain system you can run the script below to scan systems for Domain Admin Tasks. Similar to the last technique you will need to enumerate the Domain Admins first. In the script below <b>ips.txt contains a list of the target systems</b>and the <b>names.txt contains a list of the Domain Admins</b>.<br/>
<br/>
FOR /F %i in (ips.txt) DO @echo [+] %i &amp;&amp; @tasklist /V /S %i /U user /P password 2&gt;NUL &gt; output.txt &amp;&amp;<br/>
FOR /F %n in (names.txt) DO @type output.txt | findstr %n &gt; NUL &amp;&amp; echo [!] %n was found running a process on %i &amp;&amp; pause<br/>

<br/>
What this command does, is take a file containing a list of ip addresses (ips.txt) and runs tasklist against each one, redirecting the output to a text file (output.txt). For each ip, the command checks the output for the existence of a string matching one of a list of usernames from another text file (names.txt). If it finds a match, it reports the match to the user and pauses, giving the user the option to continue. <br/>
<br/>
With this command, you can easily crawl an entire domain for a running process executed by one of the Domain Administrator accounts you discovered via NBTEnum. When you find one, simply psexec your way to the system as Local Administrator, impersonate the Domain Administrator using the token on the box, and create your own shiny, new Domain Administrator credentials. </body></html>
