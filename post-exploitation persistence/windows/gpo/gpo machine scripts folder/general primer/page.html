<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Assumptions<br/>
  You have already elevated or have Local Admin context on the box<br/>
  Have the ability to upload a file in your agent (CobaltStike) / Have a Deployable .BAT/PS script<br/>
  Willing to drop something to disk for persistence<br/>
<br/>
The current process I use to deploy a Cobalt Strike Fully Staged Beacon:<br/>
<br/>
  Enumerate current GPO scripts<br/>
  Remove the psscripts.ini<br/>
  Upload a new psscripts.ini<br/>
  Upload the Beacon.ps1 scripts<br/>
  conduct a Gpupdate<br/>
  On restart you should get a beacon!<br/>
<br/>
The location of interest (while this seems trivial, do to the permissions on this directory you will have to force all commands):<br/>
<br/>
As you will noticed the structure goes (the 0Cmd.. is incremental):<br/>
[ScriptsConfig]<br/>
StartExecutePSFirst=true<br/>
[Startup]<br/>
0CmdLine=beacon2.ps1<br/>
0Parameters=<br/>
<br/>
