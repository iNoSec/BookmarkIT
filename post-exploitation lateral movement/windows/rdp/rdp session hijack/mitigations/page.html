<title>Mitigations</title>
</head><body>Group Policy — I strongly recommend you use Group Policy to log off disconnected sessions, either immediately or soon after the user disconnects. This will NOT be popular in IT environments — but the risk is now completely real that they can very easily — with one built in command — be hijacked more or less silently in the real world. I would also log off idle sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t expose RDS/RDP to the internet — if you do, I strongly suggest you implement multi-factor authentication. You can use things like Microsoft RD Gateway or Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server to get very low cost multi-factor authentication. If you’re exposing RDP directly to the internet and somebody creates a local user or your domain users have easy to guess or reused credentials, things will go downhill fast. Trust me — I’ve seen hospitals and others be ransomware’d by RDS servers.<br/>
<br/>
Monitoring<br/>
It is surprisingly very difficult to record session hijacking — there is one event log (Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational) which records sessions connecting — however it does not appear to differentiate between a normal user connecting and tscon.exe being used — I’ve been through every other event log and can’t see anything which suggests this is happening. This is actually a major issue and I lobby Microsoft to add some kind of Event Log ASAP — it’s a real gap.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is you alert for other related behaviour using the Event Log and tools like Microsoft OMS, Windows Event Forwarding, Splunk etc. You’re looking for SYSTEM being misused.<br/>
<br/>
For example abnormal Service creation and abnormal scheduled task creation should be logged centrally, and recorded against. Additionally, you can look for Mimikatz related activity.</body></html>
