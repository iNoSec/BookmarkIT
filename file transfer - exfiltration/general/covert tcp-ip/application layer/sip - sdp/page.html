<title>SIP / SDP</title>
</head><body>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP). Mazurczyk and Szczypiorski<br/>
[77] suggest to use some tokens and fields in SIP for hiding data, like randomly generated tag in From field<br/>
(which forms SIP dialog identifier), branch in Via field (which forms transaction identifier), Call-ID field (which<br/>
uniquely identifies a call), first part of CSeq field (initial sequence number that serves as a way to identify and<br/>
order transactions), Max-Forwards fields and several other fields. They also suggest to hide data in SDP in the<br/>
fields v (version field ignored by SIP), o (owner/creator), s (session name - field ignored by SIP), t (time session<br/>
is active - field ignored by SIP), and k (potential encryption key if the secure communication is used). Another<br/>
covert channel exploits the fact that the order of headers in the SIP/SDP message depends on implementation,<br/>
thus reordering of headers is possible as a mean to covertly send data. For example, Call-ID field after CSeq field<br/>
is binary 1, and opposite is binary 0. Fields are not case sensitive, so one can create channel by using upcase for<br/>
binary 1 and lowercase for binary 0.<br/>
The authors of [77] suggest also creating of covert channels in SIP and SDP using security mechanisms for<br/>
providing authentication and confidentiality. SDP content embedded into the SIP INVITE message, may be<br/>
encrypted and signed using S/MIME, and the secured parts of the message are divided from themselves using<br/>
boundary randomly generated value, so this is first possible covert channel. Second possibility is to use the<br/>
signature bits inside the boundary values (application/pkcs7-signature) to transfer covert data.</body></html>
