# Summary<br/>
<br/>
Siofra is a tool designed to identify and exploit DLL hijacking vulnerabilities <br/>
in Windows programs. It is able to simulate the Windows loader in order to give <br/>
visibility into all of the dependencies (and corresponding vulnerabilities) of <br/>
a PE on disk, or alternatively an image file in memory corresponding to an active <br/>
process. More significantly, the tool has the ability to easily generate DLLs to <br/>
exploit these types of vulnerabilities via PE infection with dynamic shellcode creation. <br/>
These infected DLLs retain the code (DllMain, exported functions) as well as the <br/>
resources of a DLL to seamlessly preserve the functionality of the application loading <br/>
them, while at the same time allowing the researcher to specify an executable payload <br/>
to be either run as a separate process or loaded into the target as a module. Additionally, <br/>
the tool contains automated methods of combining UAC auto-elevation criteria with <br/>
the aforementioned functionality in order to scan for UAC bypass vulnerabilities.</body></html>
