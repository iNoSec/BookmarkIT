<title>Port Scanning</title>
</head><body>==== Port Scanning ====<br/>
Port scanning techniques will vary based on the amount of time available for the test, and the need to be stealthy. If there is zero knowledge of the systems, a fast ping scan can be used to identify systems. In addition, a quick scan without ping verification (-PN in nmap) should be run to detect the most common ports avialable. Once this is complete, a more comprehensive scan can be run. Some testers check for only open TCP ports, make sure to check UDP as well. The http://nmap.org/nmap_doc.html document details port scan types. Nmap (&quot;Network Mapper&quot;) is the de facto standard for network auditing/scanning. Nmap runs on both Linux and Windows.<br/>
<br/>
You can find more information on the use of Nmap for this purpose in the [http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines#Nmap_.28Windows.2FLinux.29 PTES Technical Guideline]<br/>
<br/>
Nmap has dozens of options available. Since this section is dealing with port scanning, we will focus on the commands required to perform this task. It is important to note that the commands utilized depend mainly on the time and number of hosts being scanned. The more hosts or less time that you have to perform this tasks, the less that we will interrogate the host. This will become evident as we continue to discuss the options.<br/>
<br/>
IPv6 should also be tested.</body></html>
