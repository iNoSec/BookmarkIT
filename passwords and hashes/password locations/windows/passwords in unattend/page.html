<title>Passwords in Unattend</title>
</head><body>If administrators fail to clean up after this process, an EXtensible Markup Language (XML) file called Unattend is left on the local system. This file contains all the configuration settings that were set during the installation process, some of which can include the configuration of local accounts, to include Administrator accounts!<br/>
<br/>
While it’s a good idea to search the entire drive, Unattend files are likely to be found within the following folders:<br/>
<br/>
C:\unattend.txt<br/>
C:\Windows\Panther\<br/>
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\<br/>
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattended.xml<br/>
C:\Windows\System32\<br/>
C:\Windows\System32\sysprep\<br/>
C:\sysprep.inf<br/>
C:\sysprep\sysprep.xml<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note: In addition to Unattend.xml files, be on the lookout for sysprep.xml and sysprep.inf files on the file system. <br/>
<br/>
Microsoft appends “Password” to all passwords within Unattend files before encoding them; therefore, our Local Administrator password is in fact just “P@ssword123!”.<br/>
