<title>Dynamic Analysis Detection</title>
</head><body>Dynamic Analysis Detection:<br/>
<br/>
Also while writing the sandbox detection mechanism we need to obfuscate our methods, if the heuristic engine detects any sign of anti reverse engineering methods it would be very bad for malware’s threat score.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Is Debugger Present:</b><br/>
<br/>
Our first AV detection mechanism will be checking for debugger in our process<br/>
<br/>
There is a windows API function for this operation it ”Determines whether the calling process is being debugged by a user-mode debugger.” but we will not use it because of most AV products are monitoring the win API calling statements, they probably detect and treat this function as a anti reverse engineering method. Instead of using the win API function we will go and look at the “BeingDebuged” byte at PEB block.<br/>
<br/>
// bool WINAPI IsDebuggerPresent(void);<br/>
__asm<br/>
{<br/>
CheckDebugger:<br/>
 PUSH EAX          // Save the EAX value to stack<br/>
 MOV EAX, [FS:0x30]     // Get PEB structure address<br/>
 MOV EAX, [EAX+0x02]     // Get being debugged byte<br/>
 TEST EAX, EAX        // Check if being debuged byte is set<br/>
 JNE CheckDebugger      // If debugger present check again<br/>
 POP EAX           // Put back the EAX value<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
With some inline assembly this piece of code points a pointer to the BeingDebuged byte in PEB block, if debugger present it will check again until a overflow occurs in stack, when an overflow occurs the stack canaries will trigger an exception and process will be closed, this is the shortest way to exit the program. Manually checking the BeingDebuged byte will bypass good amount of AV product but still some AV products have taken measures about this issue so we need to obfuscate the code for avoiding the static string analysis.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Load Fake Library:</b><br/>
<br/>
This method we will try to load a non existing dll on runtime. Normally when we try to load a non existing dll HISTENCE returns NULL, but some dynamic analysis mechanisms in AV products allows such cases in order to further investigate the execution flow of the program.<br/>
<br/>
 bool BypassAV(char const * argv[]) {<br/>
 HINSTANCE DLL = LoadLibrary(TEXT(&quot;fake.dll&quot;));<br/>
 if (DLL != NULL) {<br/>
  BypassAV(argv);<br/>
 }<br/>
<br/>
<b>Get Tick Count:</b><br/>
<br/>
In this method we will be exploiting the time deadline of AV products. In most cases AV scanners are being designed for end user, they need to be user friendly and suitable for daily usage this means they can’t spend too much time for scanning files they need to scan files as quickly as possible. At first malware developers used “sleep()” function for waiting until the scan complete, but nowadays this trick almost never works, every AV product skips the sleep function when they encountered one. We will use this against them , below code uses a win API function called “GetTickCount()” this function “Retrieves the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was started, up to 49.7 days.” we will use it to get the time passed since OS booted, then try to sleep 1 second, after sleep function we will check weather sleep function is skipped or not by comparing the two GetTickCout() value.<br/>
<br/>
int Tick = GetTickCount();<br/>
 Sleep(1000);<br/>
 int Tac = GetTickCount();<br/>
 if ((Tac - Tick) &lt; 1000) {<br/>
  return false;<br/>
 }<br/>
<br/>
<b>Number Of Cores:</b><br/>
<br/>
This method will simply check the number of processor cores on the system. Since AV products can’t afford allocating too much resource from host computer we can check the core number in order to determine are we in a sandbox or not. Even some AV products does not support multi core processing so they shouldn’t be able to reserve more than 1 processor core to their sandbox environment.<br/>
<br/>
SYSTEM_INFO SysGuide;<br/>
GetSystemInfo(&amp;SysGuide);<br/>
int CoreNum = SysGuide.dwNumberOfProcessors;<br/>
if (CoreNum &lt; 2) {<br/>
 return false;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
<b>Huge Memory Allocations:</b><br/>
<br/>
This method also exploits the time deadline on each AV scan, we simply allocate nearly 100 Mb of memory then we will fill it with NULL bytes, at the end we will free it.<br/>
<br/>
char * Memdmp = NULL;<br/>
Memdmp = (char *)malloc(100000000);<br/>
if (Memdmp != NULL) {<br/>
 memset(Memdmp, 00, 100000000);<br/>
 free(Memdmp);<br/>
}<br/>
When the programs memory starts to grow on runtime eventually AV scanners will end the scan for the sake of not to spend too much time on a file, this method can be used multiple times. This is a very primitive and old technique but it still bypasses good amount of scanners.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Trap Flag Manipulation:</b><br/>
<br/>
The trap flag is used for tracing the program. If this flag is set every instruction will raise “SINGLE_STEP” exception.Trap flag can be manipulated in order thwart tracers. We can manipulate the trap flag with below code<br/>
<br/>
__asm<br/>
{<br/>
 PUSHF    // Push all flags to stack<br/>
 MOV DWORD [ESP], 0x100 // Set 0x100 to the last flag on the stack<br/>
 POPF     // Put back all flags register values  <br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
<b>Mutex Triggered WinExec:</b><br/>
<br/>
This method is very promising because of its simplicity, we create a condition for checking whether a certain mutex object already exists on the system or not.<br/>
<br/>
HANDLE AmberMutex = CreateMutex(NULL, TRUE, &quot;FakeMutex&quot;);<br/>
if(GetLastError() != ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS){<br/>
 WinExec(argv[0],0);<br/>
}<br/>
If “CreateMutex” function does not return already exists error we execute the malware binary again, since most of the AV products don’t let programs witch are dynamically analyzing to start new processes or access the files outside the AV sandbox, when the already exist error occurs execution of the decrypt function may start. There are much more creative ways of mutex usage in anti detection.<br/>
