<title>Double Pivoting</title>
</head><body>8.8.8.0/24 network was discovered in the information gathering process for the JC system. We already have a routing rule between 172.16.0.0/24 and 7.7.7.0/24 networks via the first compromised machine.<br/>
<br/>
In the present case, network packages that comes from 172.16.0.20 to access the JC device (second compromised machine) first go to the RD device (first compromised machine), and the RD transmits those packages to the JC machine.<br/>
<br/>
If the attacker who is 172.16.0.20 wishes to access 8.8.8.0/24 -newly discovered second hidden networkâ€“ network, a new routing rule must be defined. In the tools we will use outside the Metasploit Framework, we must run a new socks4 proxy server to connect these two pivots and define the new proxy server in the configuration file of the proxychains tool.<br/>
<br/>
Network packages attempting to reach the 8.8.8.9 destination from the attacker machine (172.16.0.20) will pass through two different points:<br/>
<br/>
RD: I do not know how to access the 8.8.8.9 IP address. But I know the system who knows how to access it. I can direct you to it.<br/>
JC: I know how to forward packets from the 7.7.7.0/24 network to the 8.8.8.0/24 network.<br/>
The final state of the compromised and discovered systems is as follows.<br/>

Holy Proxychains<br/>
The ProxyChains tool connects the proxy servers and transmits the connection end to end. In the last phase, a new socks4 proxy server is run on the local 1081 port for the newly discovered 8.8.8.0/24 network.<br/>
<br/>
The information of the new proxy server will define in the /etc/proxychains.conf configuration file. By activating the Dynamic Chain setting, sequential switching between the defined proxy servers is ensured.<br/>
