</head><body>A &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; is a <i>homemade</i>ticket<br/>
	It's made with a lot of love<br/>
	and a key<br/>
<br/>
It's not made by the KDC so: <br/>
	It's not limited by GPO or other settings<br/>
	You can push whatever you want inside<br/>
 	It's smartcard independent<br/>
<br/>
But a golden ticket is not only about lifetime modification (10 years is hardcoded, but can be modified)<br/>
Interesting part is about to modify data into, life lifetime, but mainly the Microsoft PAC:<br/>
	Groups (Domain/Enterprise Admins, by example)<br/>
	SID<br/>
	Username<br/>
<br/>
Kerberos is Stateless<br/>
All account policy info is in the TGT<br/>
	Disabled / Expired /Outside of logon hours<br/>
	Password expired<br/>
	Authentication silo membership<br/>
	&quot;Protected Users&quot; is just a group membership in the PAC<br/>
	Group Membership in the PAC<br/>
This means that ALL account policy is <i>Client Side Enforced</i><br/>
<br/>
