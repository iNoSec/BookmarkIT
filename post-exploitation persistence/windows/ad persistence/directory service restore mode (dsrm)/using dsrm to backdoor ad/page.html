<title>Using DSRM to Backdoor AD</title>
</head><body>What’s interesting about the DSRM password is that the DSRM account is actually “Administrator”. This means that once an attacker has the DSRM password for a Domain Controller (or DCs), it’s possible to use this account to logon to the Domain Controller over the network as a local administrator.<br/>
<br/>
We can confirm this with Mimikatz by creating a new AD user with a known password. Set the DSRM acount password sync from the domain user account and compare the hashes.<br/>

DSRMTest NTLM Password Hash: 2b391dfc6690cc38547d74b8bd8a5b49<br/>
Administrator (500) Local Account NTLM Password Hash: 2b391dfc6690cc38547d74b8bd8a5b49<br/>

The second graphic shows a local Administrator account on the DC called “Administrator” with the same password hash as the DSRMTest domain user account.</body></html>
