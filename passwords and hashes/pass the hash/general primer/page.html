<br/>
Pass The Hash is a technique utilized by penetration testers as well as attackers after an initial foothold to authenticate to other networked Windows machines with compromised NT LAN Manager (NTLM) password hashes. This is possible due to how Windows implements its NTLM authentication scheme. After login, attempts to authenticate to other networked computers, file shares, and other resources with NTLM will result in a challenge/response which includes the user name and password hash (computed with the original challenge value). No plaintext password ever exchanged!  These hashes are stored in several places. For local accounts, each machine will store the associated hash values in the Security Account Management (SAM) Database. In a Domain environment, hashes for all accounts in Active Directory are stored on the Domain Controller in a file called “NTDS.dit”. Finally, credentials can also be stored in memory (plaintext in some cases) during interactive sessions such as logging in at the console or through remote sessions (RDP).<br/>
<br/>
It is important to note that accessing these credentials requires privileged access (SYSTEM, Local/Domain Administrators) to the SAM database for local accounts or Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process for interactive logins.<br/>
<br/>
Windows will gladly accept NTLM hash values in many situations, such as accessing a network resource by its IP address (vs. hostname) or connecting to a device that isn’t joined to the Domain. The only only time hashes would not be exchanged would be when requesting network resources in a Kerberos-exclusive environment, but that type of implementation is rare and can be problematic for many organizations to implement.<br/>
