<title>sdclt.exe App Path</title>
</head><body>sdclt requires a script/file on the system, and therefore is not fileless like the eventvwr bypass which uses the registry<br/>
There is another separate sdclt bypass that is fileless.<i><br/>
</i><i><br/>
</i><i>*Note: This only works on Windows 10. The manifest for sdclt.exe in Windows 7 has the requestedExecutionLevel set to “AsInvoker”, preventing auto-elevation when started from medium integrity.</i><br/>
<ul><li>When observing the execution flow of sdclt.exe, it becomes apparent that this binary starts control.exe in order to open up a Control Panel item in high-integrity context</li>
<li>sdclt.exe queries the App Path key for control.exe within the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive.</li>
<li>Calls to HKEY_CURRENT_USER (or HKCU) from a high integrity process are particularly interesting. This often means that an elevated process is interacting with a registry location that a medium integrity process can tamper with. In this case, I saw that “sdclt.exe” was querying <b>HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe.</b></li>
<li>As it stands, sdclt.exe looks for the App Path of control.exe in the HKCU hive. Essentially, this binary is asking “what is the full path of control.exe?”. If that key isn’t found, it continues the typical Windows search order. Since it is searching in a place that can be modified, we can populate the key. </li>
</ul>
<br/>
It is important to note that this technique does not allow for parameters, meaning it requires your payload to be placed on disk someplace. If you try to give the binary any parameters (e.g, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c calc.exe), it will interpret the entire string as the lpFile value to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb759784(v=vs.85).aspx">ShellExecuteInfo</a>structure, which is then passed over to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762154(v=vs.85).aspx">ShellExecuteEx</a>. Since that value doesn’t exist, it will not execute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This particular technique can be remediated or fixed by setting the UAC level to “Always Notify” or by removing the current user from the Local Administrators group. Further, if you would like to monitor for this attack, you could utilize methods/signatures to look for and alert on new registry entries in <b>HKCU\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\Control.exe</b>.<br/>
