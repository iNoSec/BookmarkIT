<title>Customer Data</title>
</head><body>==== Customer Data ====<br/>
Much like employee data, customer data is considered a business asset in the threat modeling process when such information will incur a direct/indirect loss to the organization. On top of regulatory/compliance need (based on fines), an additional factor comes into play here when such data can be used to conduct fraud, where the organization may be held liable or sued for the losses related to the fraud (based on losing the customer information that enabled the fraud to take place).<br/>
The following list provides examples of such information realms that may hold relevant customer data and should be considered business assets for the sake of the threat modeling<br/>
* National Identification Numbers (SSN’s, etc.)<br/>
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)<br/>
* Protected Health Information (PHI)<br/>
* Financial Accounts (e.g. bank, credit, equity accounts)<br/>
* Supplier Data<br/>
Information related to suppliers that is considered critical to the organization (such as critical component manufacturers, agreements with suppliers that may be part of a trade secret, cost analysis of supplied components), as well as any data that may be used to affect the business operations of the organization through its suppliers is considered a business asset.<br/>
* Partner Data<br/>
* “Cloud” Service Account Information</body></html>
