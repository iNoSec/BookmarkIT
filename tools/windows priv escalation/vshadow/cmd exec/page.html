<title>CMD Exec</title>
</head><body>Command Execution<br/>
Executing commands with Vshadow is dependent upon a ‘successful’ interaction with a shadow copy operation (e.g. creating a snapshot, removing a snapshot, doing something with a snapshot, etc.). Vshadow.exe supports the -exec parameter, which can be used to execute a binary (.exe) or a script (.bat/.cmd). The<i>-exec parameter does not support command arguments</i>, so payload execution needs to be wrapped up within the context of these limitations.<br/>
<br/>
Before proceeding, let’s consider a few other requirements for command execution. <br/>
<br/>
Firstly, we need to have privileges on the machine (e.g. administrator) as working with volume snapshots (and invoking the Volume Shadow Service) is deemed a sensitive operation. <br/>
Secondly, we need to get the Vshadow executable onto the target machine. If the Windows SDK is already installed, then all we have to do is locate the path to the binary on disk. Otherwise, we’ll have to transfer it over. <br/>
Lastly, we need to ensure that our payload is wrapped up as discussed previously. For our command execution example, we will simply use notepad.exe as our payload.<br/>
<br/>
Invoking a payload with vshadow.exe is not exactly the stealthiest method, but we can operate the tool in such a way to minimize our footprint. The basic structure of our command is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
vshadow.exe -nw -exec=&lt;\path\to\exe&gt; &lt;system drive&gt;<br/>
Specifying -nw allows us to create a shadow copy without invoking shadow copy writers. Effectively, this is a non-persistent shadow copy, which will not leave “physical” disk evidence (*Please note that this does not necessarily prevent the detection of shadow copy creation as we are still going through the simulated process). Now, let’s run the following command:<br/>
<br/>
vshadow.exe -nw -exec=c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe c:<br/>
<br/>
Successful execution of Vshadow in this context will create a ‘faux’ shadow copy set, then launch the payload (notepad.exe) as specified by the -exec parameter. A few interesting things are happening here that may be useful for defensive and forensics folks to know…<br/>
<br/>
Vshadow.exe will not finish executing until the child process is finished executing.<br/>
The payload (notepad.exe) is a child process of vshadow.exe<br/>
Successful execution of Vshadow will kick off the Volume Shadow Service (VSS) as indicated by System Event ID 7036 and invocation of the VSSVC.exe process.<br/>
