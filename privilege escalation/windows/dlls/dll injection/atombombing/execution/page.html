<title>Execution</title>
</head><body>Obviously I could never hope to consistently find RWX code caves in my target processes. I needed a way to consistently allocate RWX memory in the target process without calling VirtualAllocEx within the context of the injecting process. Sadly, I could not find any such function that I could invoke via APC and would allow me to allocate executable memory or change the protection flags of already allocated memory.<br/>
<br/>
What do we have so far? Write-what-where + a burning desire to get some executable memory. I thought long and hard how to get over this hurdle, and then it hit me. When DEP was invented, its creators thought, “that’s it, data is no longer executable, therefore no one will ever be able to exploit vulnerabilities again”. Unfortunately, that was not the case; a new exploitation technique was invented solely to bypass DEP: ROP – Return Oriented Programming.<br/>
<br/>
How can we use ROP to our advantage in order to execute our shellcode in the target process? We can copy our code to an RW code cave in the target process (using the method described in stage 1). Then use a meticulously crafted ROP chain to allocate RWX memory, copy the code from the RW code cave to the newly allocated RWX memory, and finally jump to the RWX memory and execute it.<br/>
<br/>
Finding an RW code cave is not a big problem. For this proof of concept, I decided to use the unused space after the data section of kernelbase.<br/>

<b>The ROP Chain </b><br/>
Our ROP chain needs to do 3 things:<br/>
<ul><li>Allocate RWX memory</li>
<li>Copy the shellcode from the RW code cave to the newly allocated RWX memory</li>
<li>Execute the newly allocated RWX memory</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>ROP Chain Step 1: Allocating RWX Memory </b><br/>
We would like to allocate some RWX memory. The first function that comes to mind is VirtualAlloc – a very useful function that can be used to allocate RWX memory. The only problem is that the function returns the newly allocated RWX memory in EAX which would make our ROP chain complicated by having to find a way to pass the value VirtualAlloc stored in EAX to the next function in the chain.<br/>
<br/>
A very neat trick can be employed in order to simplify our ROP chain and make it more sophisticated. Instead of using VirtualAlloc, we can use ZwAllocateVirtualMemory, which returns the newly allocated RWX memory as an output parameter. This way we can actually set up our stack so that ZwAllocateVirtualMemory stores the newly allocated memory further along the stack, effectively passing the address to the next function in the chain (see Table 1).<br/>
<br/>
<b>ROP Chain Step 2: Copying the Shellcode </b><br/>
The next function we need is a function that will copy memory from one buffer to another. Two options come to mind: memcpy and RtlMoveMemory. When creating this kind of ROP chain one might be initially inclined to go with RtlMoveMemory because it uses the stdcall calling convention, meaning it will clean up the stack after itself. This is a special case though. We need to copy memory to an address (placed on the stack by ZwAllocateVirtualMemory) and then somehow this address needs to be called. If we used RtlMoveMemory, it will pop the address of the RWX shellcode right off the stack upon its return. On the other hand, if we use memcpy, the first entry on the stack would be the return address of memcpy, followed by the destination parameter of memcpy (i.e. the RWX shellcode).<br/>
<br/>
<b>ROP Chain Step 3: Executing the newly allocated RWX memory </b><br/>
We have allocated RWX memory and copied our shellcode to it. We are about to return from memcpy but the address of the RWX shellcode on the stack is 4 bytes away from the return address. Therefore, all we have to do is add an extremely simple gadget to our ROP chain. This simple gadget will execute the opcode “ret”. memcpy will return to this simple gadget which will “ret” right into our RWX shellcode.<br/>

<br/>
For those who have to see it to believe it:<br/>
<br/>
Set EIP to point to ZwAllocateVirtualMemory, and ESP to point to this ROP chain:<br/>
Address 		Value 			Comment<br/>
0x30000000 	ntdll!memcpy 	// Return address from ZwAllocateVirtualMemory<br/>
0x30000004 	0xffffffff 			// Pseudo handle to the current process<br/>
0x30000008 	0x30000020 		// Where to store the allocated memory<br/>
0x3000000C 	NULL 			// Irrelevant<br/>
0x30000010 	0x30000028 		// Pointer to the size of the needed memory<br/>
0x30000014 	MEM_COMMIT 	// Commit and not reserve<br/>
0x30000018 	PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE<br/>
	// RWX<br/>
0x3000001C 	POINTER_TO_SOME_RET_INSTRUCTION 	// Return Address from memcpy, our extremely simple ret gadget.<br/>
0x30000020 	NULL 				// Where the allocated memory will be saved and the destination parameter of memcpy. This will store the address of the RWX shellcode.<br/>
0x30000024 	CODE_CAVE_ADDRESS 	// The RW code cave containing the shellcode to be copied<br/>
0x30000028 	SHELLCODE_SIZE 		// The size of the shellcode to be allocated<br/>

<b>Invoking the ROP Chain</b><br/>
But wait, APCs allow me to send 3 parameters. Obviously I need to store 11 parameters on the stack. Our best bet is to pivot the stack to some RW memory which will contain our ROP chain (e.g. the RW code cave in kernelbase).<br/>
<br/>
How could we pivot the stack?<br/>
NTSYSAPI NTSTATUS NTAPI NtSetContextThread(<br/>
_In_    HANDLE hThread, <br/>
_In_ const CONTEXT *lpContext<br/>
);<br/>
<br/>
This syscall will set the context (register values) of hThread to the values contained in lpContext. If we can get the target process to call this syscall with an lpContext that will set ESP to point to our ROP chain and set EIP to point to ZwAllocateVirtualMemory, then our ROP chain will execute. The execution of the ROP chain will eventually lead to the execution of our shellcode.<br/>
<br/>
How do we get the target process to make this call? APC has been good to us so far, but this syscall expects 2 parameters and not 3, so when it returns the stack will be corrupt, and the behavior will be undefined. That said, if we pass a handle to the current thread as hThread, then the function will never return. The reason is that once execution gets passed on to the kernel, the context of the thread will be set to the context specified by lpContext, and there will be no trace that NtSetContextThread was ever called. If everything works out as we hope, we will have successfully hijacked a thread and got it to execute our malicious shellcode.<br/>
