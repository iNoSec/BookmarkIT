<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enumerator/0.1.4">Enumerator</a>| enumerator is a tool built to assist in automating the often tedious task of enumerating a target or list of targets during a penetration test.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/jekil/hostmap">hostmap</a>| hostmap is a free, automatic, hostnames and virtual hosts discovery tool written in Ruby by Alessandro Tanasi<br/>
<a href="http://angryip.org/">Angry IP Scanner</a>| Angry IP Scanner (or simply ipscan) is an open-source and cross-platform network scanner designed to be fast and simple to use. It scans IP addresses and ports as well as has many other features.<br/>
<a href="http://www.hping.org/">hping</a>| hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/consul">Consul</a>| Consul is a tool for service discovery and configuration. Consul is distributed, highly available, and extremely scalable.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/m0rtem/CloudFail">CloudFail</a>| CloudFail is a tactical reconnaissance tool which aims to gather enough information about a target protected by CloudFlare in the hopes of discovering the location of the server.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/leebaird/discover">discover - Kali Scripts</a>| For use with Kali Linux - custom bash scripts used to automate various portions of a pentest.<br/>
<a href="http://packetfactory.openwall.net/projects/firewalk/">Firewalk</a>| Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will pass. Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response. To get the correct IP TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need to ramp up hop-counts. We do this in the same manner that traceroute works. Once we have the gateway hopcount (at that point the scan is said to beÂ bound) we can begin our scan.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ajohnston9/ciscorouter">CiscoRouter - tool</a>| CiscoRouter is a tool for scanning Cisco-based routers over SSH. Rules can be created using accompanying CiscoRule application (see this repo) and stored in the &quot;rules&quot; directory.<br/>
