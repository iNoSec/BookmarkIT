</head><body>Introduction to Scope<br/>
Defining scope is arguably one of the most important components of a penetration test, yet it is also one of the most overlooked. While many volumes have been written about the different tools and techniques which can be utilized to gain access to a network, very little has been written on the topic which precedes the penetration: preparation. Neglecting to properly complete pre-engagement activities has the potential to open the penetration tester (or his firm) to a number of headaches including scope creep, unsatisfied customers, and even legal troubles. The scope of a project specifically defines what is to be tested. How each aspect of the test will be conducted will be covered in the Rules of Engagement section.<br/>
<br/>
One key component of scoping an engagement is outlining how the testers should spend their time. As an example, a customer requests that one hundred IP addresses be tested for the price of $100,000. This means that the customer is offering $1,000 per IP address tested. However, this cost structure only remains effective at that volume. A common trap some testers fall into is maintaining linear costs throughout the testing process. If the customer had only asked for one business-critical application to be tested at the same pricing structure ($1,000), while the tester will still be only attacking a single IP, the volume of work has increased dramatically. It is important to vary costs based on work done. Otherwise a firm can easily find themselves undercharging for their services, which motivates them to do a less than complete job.<br/>
<br/>
Despite having a solid pricing structure, the process is not all black and white. It is not uncommon for a client to be completely unaware of exactly what it is they need tested. It is also possible the client will not know how to communicate effectively what theyâ€™re expecting from the test. It is important in the Pre-Engagement phase that the tester is able to serve as a guide through what may be uncharted territory for a customer. The tester must understand the difference between a test which focuses on a single application with severe intensity and a test where the client provides a wide range of IP addresses to test and the goal is to simply find a way in.</body></html>
