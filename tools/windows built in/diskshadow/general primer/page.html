</head><body>What is DiskShadow?<br/>
“DiskShadow.exe is a tool that exposes the functionality offered by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). By default, DiskShadow uses an interactive command interpreter similar to that of DiskRaid or DiskPart. DiskShadow also includes a scriptable mode.“<br/>
<br/>
DiskShadow is included in Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016 and is a Windows signed binary.<br/>
<br/>
The VSS features of DiskShadow require privileged-level access (with UAC elevation), however, several command utilities can be invoked by a non-privileged user. This makes DiskShadow a very interesting candidate for command execution and evasive persistence.</body></html>
