<title>ICMP</title>
</head><body>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is another connectionless protocol on Internet layer, used to<br/>
transfer error messages and other information between the nodes. ICMP messages are send encapsulated in IP<br/>
packets. There are 14 (and 16 deprecated) different types of ICMP messages, which have common only first 4 byte<br/>
of the 8-byte ICMP header. Project Loki [22, 23] demonstrated a covert channel by putting arbitrary information<br/>
tunnelling in the payload of ICMP Echo Request and ICMP Echo Reply packets. Additionally, the Loki client<br/>
allows a remote attacker to wrap and transmit commands in ICMP payloads and the Loki server, unwraps and<br/>
executes the commands, sending the results back wrapped in ICMP packets. This channel will work for any<br/>
network device which does not filter the contents of ICMP Echo traffic, and is very simple to deploy.<br/>
Other implementations of IP-over-ICMP tunnels are ICMPTX [113], Skeeve [128], ICMP-Chat [84], etc. Their<br/>
PRBR depends on operating system and implementation, and can goes up to 24B, 56B or more. <br/>
