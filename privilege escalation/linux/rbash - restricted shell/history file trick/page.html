<title>History File Trick</title>
</head><body>1: set HISTFILE variable to a file you want to overwrite<br/>
2: set HISTSIZE variable to 0 and then immediately to 100<br/>
3: Execute lines that you want to be written to your file<br/>
4: Log out and back in. You have overwritten contents of HISTFILE pointed to (also, original file permissions are same!)</body></html>
