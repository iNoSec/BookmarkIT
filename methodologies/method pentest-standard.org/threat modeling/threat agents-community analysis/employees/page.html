<title>Employees</title>
</head><body>===Employees===<br/>
Persons working directly for the company under a part-time or full-time contract. In general they are not regarded as posing a severe threat as most of them are relying on the company<br/>
to make a living and, assuming they are treated well, are inclined to protect the company rather than to hurt it. Oftentimes involved in data loss incidents or accidental compromise. In<br/>
rare cases they may be motivated by outsiders to assist in intrusions or they may engage in malicious acts on their own (e.g. rogue traders). While the skill level may vary, it is usually low<br/>
to medium.</body></html>
