Notes:<br/>
This is only ever intended to be executed on your attacker system.<br/>
It will run on any system though, but you will always have to provide creds.<br/>
<br/>
You will need a valid domain controller for this to work. <br/>
How do you get a list of domain controllers without a domain system? <br/>
<br/>
Two ways:<br/>
ipconfig -&gt; will get you a DNS suffix<br/>
nltest /dclist:{domain} #will give you an error, but will also list one DC<br/>
<br/>
nslookup<br/>
set type=any<br/>
{domain} #will list name servers...generally those are DCs<br/>
<br/>
Use Cases:<br/>
1. You harvest a domain credential from a printer, responder, etc. But don't have access<br/>
to a domain system. You can use the credential to perform additional enumeration on the domain.<br/>
2. Find out what you can do with the credential you harvested. What group membership, maybe a system with similiar <br/>
naming convetion of the username which indicates the user may have local admin on the system.<br/>
3. You are provided credentials to start an internal assessment, but not a domain system.<br/>
4. You just want to do domain enumeration quickly<br/>
