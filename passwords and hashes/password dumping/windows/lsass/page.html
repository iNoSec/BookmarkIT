<title>LSASS</title>
</head><body>After a user logs on, a variety of credentials are generated and stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service">LSASS, </a>process in memory. This is meant to facilitate single sign-on (SSO) ensuring a user isn’t prompted each time resource access is requested. The credential data may include Kerberos tickets, NTLM password hashes, LM password hashes (if the password is &lt;15 characters, depending on Windows OS version and patch level), and even clear-text passwords (to support WDigest and SSP authentication among others.<br/>
<br/>
You can dump passwords from LSASS using mimikatz, procdump, or others<br/>
Typically, it is best to load mimikatz / WCE / hashdump into memory, but sometimes these solutions are not viable</body></html>
