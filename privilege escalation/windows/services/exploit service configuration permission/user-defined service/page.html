In some cases Windows users may have excessive rights that allow them to create services on the system using the Instrsrv.exe and Srvany.exe tools that come with the Windows NT resource kit. Instsrv.exe is used to install a program as a service, and Srvany.exe is used to run the program as a service. By default, the services installed with instsrv.exe should be configured to automatically start at boot time. However, you can also use the sc.exe command to ensure that it is configured how you want it. Either way, a restart may be required depending on your existing privileges. I’ve personally seen users in the “Power Users” group with the ability to install their own services, but it may be a coincidence. I recommend creating a Metasploit binary that adds a local administrator to the system, and using it to create the service. It’s easy, and the new administrator account can be used to sign in via remote desktop. However, if that’s not your cup of tea, feel free to use your favorite payloads.</body></html>
