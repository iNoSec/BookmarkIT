</head><body>ADS can be used to hide data (dir command without the /r switch will not display them; explorer.exe will also not show them; We will later see how we can even hide from the /r dir switch…)<br/>
<br/>
ADS has another great property – we can add an ADS to a folder. To be allowed to do this we must own the “create folders” permissions on the directory (and the folder name must not be a number). The important fact is that an ADS on a folder looks like a file from the parent folder!<br/>
<br/>
For example, consider that an application allows to upload data and that uploaded data is stored in applicationFolder\uploadedData\. Moreover, the application allows to start scripts / applications from applicationFolder\ but not from applicationFolder\uploadedData\ (with a blacklist approach). If the user uploads a file named “:foo.ps1″, the system will create an ADS like applicationFolder\uploadedData:foo.ps1 and this file appears to be stored inside applicationFolder\ and therefore bypassing the security checks.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting fact is that ADS names can contain symbols which are normally forbidden for filenames like ” or * (you have to create these files using the native Windows API; cmd.exe filteres these characters):<br/>
<img src="image.png"/><br/>
This on it’s own can lead to several problems (e.g.: if the filename ends with ” and the path is enclosed by ”)<br/>
