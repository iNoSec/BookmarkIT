</head><body>==== Database Servers ====<br/>
Databases contain a wealth of information that may be targeted in an assessment.<br/>
*Databases - A list of database names can help the assessor to determine the purpose of the database and the types of data the database may contain. In an environment with many databases, this will help in prioritizing targets.<br/>
*Tables - Table names and metadata, such as comments, column names and types can also help the assessor choose targets and find targeted data.<br/>
*Table Content, row count for regulated content<br/>
*Columns - It is possible in many databases to search all column names of all tables with a single command. This can be leveraged to find targeted data (e.g. If credit card data is targeted on an Oracle database, try executing ''select * from all_tab_columns where name = '%CCN%';''.<br/>
*Database and Table Permissions<br/>
*Database Users, Passwords, Groups and Roles<br/>
The information hosted on databases can be also be used to show risk, achieve assessment goals, determine configuration and function of services or to further penetrate a client network and hosts.</body></html>
