<br/>
If you're able to copy files into your PATH, then you'll be able to bypass the forward slash restriction. The sky is the limit at this point as you can copy commands into the PATH that have known shell escapes. You can also write your own script, copy it to the PATH, and execute it.<br/>
<br/>
Another technique is to try and copy files to your home directory and execute them from there. Execution will be difficult as you will have to use './' in order to get it to run, and as we already know, it will fail since the restricted shell will not allow the use of a forward slash. Keep in mind, you may be able to get the commands you copy to your home directory to run if you're able to couple it with another command that has a shell escape.<br/>
<br/>
Other ways you may be able to copy files or get access to them include mounting a device or file system. You may also be able to copy them to your system using a program that can copy files such as SCP or FTP.<br/>
<br/>
Try to find directories other than your PATH where you can execute commands from. If you have write access to them, you can copy commands here and may be able to execute them.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, consider creating a symbolic link in a directory where you have write access and the ability to run commands<br/>
<br/>
cp /bin/sh /some/dir/from/PATH; sh<br/>
