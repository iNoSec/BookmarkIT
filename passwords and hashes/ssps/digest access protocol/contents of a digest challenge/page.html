<title>Contents of a Digest Challenge</title>
</head><body>The size of a Digest Access challenge must be less than 2048 bytes. The following example shows a challenge assigned to the character string szChallenge.<br/>
<br/>
C++<br/>
<br/>
szChallenge = &quot;realm=\&quot;Microsoft_Example_Forest\&quot;,&quot;;<br/>
algorithm = &quot;MD5-sess\&quot;, qop=\&quot;auth\&quot;, nonce=\&quot;0123456789abcdef\&quot;&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
Note The challenge string is enclosed in double quotes and contains embedded double quotes. Embedded double quotes must be preceded (escaped) with a backslash (\).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A Digest challenge can contain the following directives.<br/>
Directive		Description<br/>
realm		An implementation-defined hint to the client about which credentials are required. The client should display this information to the user if it is prompting for credentials.<br/>
algorithm	Microsoft Digest supports MD5 and MD5-Sess. For optimal performance, use MD5-Sess.<br/>
qop			This directive can be set to auth, auth-int, or auth-conf. For more information, see Quality of Protection and Ciphers.<br/>
nonce		A unique encoded value generated by the server for each challenge. This value must not be altered by the client.<br/>
opaque		Contains a reference for the security context that is being established. For more information, see Maintaining the Security Context Between Connections.<br/>
cipher(SASL only) 	The list of ciphers that the server supports. This element can be present in a Digest SASL challenge only if the qop directive specifies auth-conf. For more information, see Quality of Protection and Ciphers.<br/>
charset		This directive can be set to utf-8 if the server can process UTF-8–encoded user names and realms. If the client understands the charset directive, it can respond by using UTF-8–encoded values.</body></html>
