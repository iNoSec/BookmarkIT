</head><body>Define Acceptable Social Engineering Pretexts<br/>
Many organizations will want their security posture tested in a way which is aligned with current attacks. Social engineering and spear-phishing attacks are currently widely used by many attackers today. While most of the successful attacks use pretexts like sex, drugs, and rock and roll (porn, Viagra, and free iPods respectively) some of these pretexts may not be acceptable in a corporate environment. Be sure that any pretexts chosen for the test are approved in writing before testing is to begin.</body></html>
