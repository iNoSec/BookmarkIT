</head><body><b>Bypassing UAC</b><br/>
Exploiting UAC is a trivial process. There are <b>two stages needed</b>to be taken to achieve bypass to elevate from standard user rights to administrator user rights. <br/>
<ul><li>Writing to a secure location (use iFileOperation COM Object or Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe))</li>
<li>Exploiting DLL hijacking vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<br/>
In order for our bypass to be successful to start off with we need<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"/>
<li>A medium integrity process</li>
<li>A standard user in an administrators group (required for COM / wusa)</li>
<li>Windows executable must be signed by Microsoft code signing certificate</li>
<li>Windows executable must be located in a secure directory</li>
<li>Windows executable also must specify the <b>auto Elevate</b>property in their manifest</li>
</ul>
<br/>
For auto-elevation the Windows executable must be signed, located in a secure directory such as C:\Windows\System32 and must specify the autoElevate property in their manifest.</body></html>
