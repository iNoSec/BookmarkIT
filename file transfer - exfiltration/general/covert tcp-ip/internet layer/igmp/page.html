<title>IGMP</title>
</head><body>Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a protocol for establishing multicast group memberships<br/>
on IPv4 networks. First covert channel for IGMP is suggested in [3]. Scott [101] suggests using of 8-bit and 16-bit<br/>
Reserved fields in the IGMPv3 Membership Report, which are usually set to zeroes and ignored by the receiver.<br/>
B0CK [120] is one implementation of IGMP/IPv4 covert channel, which uses the Source address field for hiding<br/>
data. While B0CK packets have the IP Protocol field set to IGMP, they contain no encapsulated IGMP header;<br/>
the packet is padded with 124 bytes of zeros after the 20-byte IP header.</body></html>
