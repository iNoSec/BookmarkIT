'''Public Research'''<br/>
<br/>
Once a vulnerability has been reported in a target system, it is necessary to determine the accuracy of the identification of the issue, and to research the potential exploitability of the vulnerability within the scope of the penetration test. In many cases, the vulnerability will be a reported software vulnerability in a commercial or open source software package, and in other cases the vulnerability can be a flaw in a business process, or a common administrative error like misconfiguration or default password usage.<br/>
<br/>
''Vulnerability Databases''<br/>
<br/>
Vulnerability databases can be used to verify an issue reported by an automated tool, or to manually review the vulnerability of a target application. Most tools will use the CVE identifier for a given vulnerability, which can be used to access the summary information and links to other sources in the CVE database. The CVE can also be used to search for the issue in vulnerability databases like OSVDB and Bugtraq, or in exploit databases and frameworks.<br/>
<br/>
Vulnerability databases should be used to verify the accuracy of a reported issue. For example, an Apache web server flaw can exist on Windows, but not on Linux, which may not be taken into account by an automated scanner.<br/>
<br/>
''Vendor Advisories''<br/>
<br/>
Vendor-issued security advisories and change logs can provide pointers to vulnerability information that may not be reported by any automated tools. Many major software vendors report limited details on internally discovered issues and issues where an independent researcher coordinates the disclosure of a vulnerability. If the researcher chooses to remain silent on the details of the vulnerability, the vendor advisory is frequently the only data available. In these cases, other researchers may discover more details independently, and add the details to vulnerability databases. Searching for the CVE used in a vendor advisory may turn up more detail on a potentially exploitable issue.<br/>
<br/>
Change logs can provide guidance for additional research, especially in open source products, where a diff between versions can reveal a vulnerability which was fixed but not widely known, and perhaps not prioritized for upgrade or installation as a result.<br/>
<br/>
'''Exploit Databases and Framework Modules'''<br/>
<br/>
Many exploit databases are actively maintained and publicly accessible on the Internet. Security researchers and exploit writers do not always submit their exploit code to multiple sites, so it is advisable to become familiar with several sites, and check each one for exploit code to use against potentially vulnerable applications. While some vulnerability databases track exploit availability, their coverage is usually incomplete and should not be considered exhaustive.<br/>
<br/>
Commercial and open source exploit frameworks can also prove useful in researching vulnerabilities. In most cases, available exploit modules are listed on their public web sites, and can be a valuable indication of the exploitability of an issue.<br/>
<br/>
'''Common/default Passwords'''<br/>
<br/>
Frequently, administrators and technicians choose weak passwords, never change the default or do not set any password at all. Manuals for most software and hardware can be easily found online, and will provide the default credentials. Internet forums and official vendor mailing lists can provide information on undocumented accounts, commonly-used passwords and frequently misconfigured accounts. Finally, many web sites document default/backdoor passwords and should be checked for every identified system.<br/>
<br/>
'''Hardening Guides/Common Misconfigurations'''<br/>
<br/>
One of the primary goals of penetration testing is to simulate the tactics and behavior of an actual attacker. While automated scanning can reduce the time window of a test, no scanner can behave like a human being. Hardening guides can be an invaluable reference for a penetration tester. They not only highlight the weakest parts of a system, but you can gain a sense of the diligence of an administrator by validating how many recommendations have been implemented. During every penetration test, time should be taken to review every major system and its recommended hardening settings, in order to discover vulnerabilities left in place by the administrator.<br/>
<br/>
User forums and mailing lists can provide valuable information about systems and the various issues administrators have in configuring and securing them. A tester should research target systems as if he were installing one himself, and discover where the pain points and probable configuration errors will lie.<br/>
<br/>
'''Private Research'''<br/>
<br/>
''Setting up a replica environment''<br/>
<br/>
Virtualization technologies allow a security researcher to run a wide variety of operating systems and applications, without requiring dedicated hardware. When a target operating system or application has been identified, a virtual machine (VM) environment can be quickly created to mimic the target. The tester can use this VM to explore to configuration parameters and behaviors of the application, without directly connecting to the target.<br/>
<br/>
''Testing Configurations''<br/>
<br/>
A testing VM lab should contain base images for all common operating systems, including Windows XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003 and Server 2008, Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Mac OS X, where possible. Maintaining separate images for each service pack level will streamline the process of recreating the targetâ€™s environment. A complete VM library in combination with a VM environment that supports cloning will allow a tester to bring up a new target VM in minutes. Additionally, using a snapshot feature will allow to work more efficiently and to reproduce bugs.<br/>
<br/>
''Fuzzing''<br/>
<br/>
Fuzzing, or fault injection, is a brute-force technique for finding application flaws by programmatically submitting valid, random or unexpected input to the application. The basic process involves attaching a debugger to the target application, and then running the fuzzing routine against specific areas of input and then analyzing the program state following any crashes. Many fuzzing applications are available, although some testers write their own fuzzers for specific targets.<br/>
<br/>
'''Identifying potential avenues/vectors'''<br/>
<br/>
Log in or connect to a target network application to identify commands and other areas of input. If the target is a desktop application that reads files and/or web pages, analyze the accepted file formats for avenues of data input. Some simple tests involve submitting invalid characters, or very long strings of characters to cause a crash. Attach a debugger to analyze the program state in the event of a successful crash.<br/>
<br/>
'''Disassembly and code analysis'''<br/>
<br/>
Some programming languages allow for decompilation, and some specific applications are compiled with symbols for debugging. A tester can take advantage of these features to analyze program flow and identify potential vulnerabilities. Source code for open source applications should be analyzed for flaws. Web applications written in PHP share many of the same vulnerabilities, and their source code should be examined as part of any test.</body></html>
