<title>RtlCreateUserThread</title>
</head><body>RtlCreateUserThread()<br/>
The ‘<a href="https://undocumented.ntinternals.net/index.html?page=UserMode%2FUndocumented%20Functions%2FExecutable%20Images%2FRtlCreateUserThread.html">RtlCreateUserThread</a>()’ is an undocumented API call. Its setup is, almost, the same as ‘CreateRemoteThread()’, and subsequently as ‘NtCreateThreadEx()’.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, ‘RtlCreateUserThread()’ calls ‘NtCreateThreadEx()’, which means ‘RtlCreateUserThread()’ is a small wrapper for ‘NtCreateThreadEx()’. So, nothing new here. However, we might want to just use ‘RtlCreateUserThread()’ instead of ‘NtCreateThreadEx()’. Even if the later changes, our ‘RtlCreateUserThread()’ should still work.<br/>
<br/>
As you might know, among others, mimikatz and Metasploit both use ‘RtlCreateUserThread()’. If you are curious, have a look here and here.<br/>
<br/>
So, if mimikatz and Metasploit are using ‘RtlCreateUserThread()’… and yes, those guys know their stuff… follow their “advice”, use ‘RtlCreateUserThread()’. Especially if you are planning to do something more serious than a simple ‘injectAllTheThings’ program.<br/>
