</head><body>=== Human assets supporting process ===<br/>
Identification of the HR that are involved in the business process should be made in conjunction with the process analysis itself (whether documented or not), and every person that has any kind of involvement (even if it does not relate to a specific information asset or a technical infrastructure element) should be documented and mapped in the process. Such HR assets are usually part of an approval sub-process, a verification sub-process, or even a reference (such as legal advice). These kinds of assets (especially ones that have no relation to information assets or technical infrastructure) would be later mapped to attack vectors that are more social than technical in nature.</body></html>
