<br/>
Anti-virus is a technology aimed at preventing malicious software from being deployed on the system. As a penetration tester we should be able to identify these types of anti-virus technologies and be able to protect against them. Anti-virus is a small subset of all of the different preventative measures that can be in place, for example host-based intrusion prevention systems, web application firewalls, and other preventative technologies.</body></html>
