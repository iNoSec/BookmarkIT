Design:<br/>
<br/>
Use strong ciphers (AES 128 or better) with secure mode of operations (do not use ECB).<br/>
Use strong hashes (SHA 256 or better) with salts for passwords.<br/>
Protect keys more than any other asset.<br/>
Mandate strong encrypted communications between web and database servers and any other servers or administrative users.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: Only certain personally identifiable information and sensitive values MUST be encrypted. Encrypt data that would be embarrassing or costly if it was leaked or stolen.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: It is best to encrypt data on the application server, rather than the database server.</body></html>
