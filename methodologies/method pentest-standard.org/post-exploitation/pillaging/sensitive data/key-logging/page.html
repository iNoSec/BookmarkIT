</head><body>==== Key-logging ====<br/>
By monitoring key strokes it is possible to detect sensitive information including passwords and PII - Donâ€™t know what the legality of this is if the user is say chatting on private IM while also using company software, anyone know? If the company says that all data on the network can be monitored then this should be ok. If the second bullet point in Protect Yourself is present and it states that use of equipment can be monitored and no personal use is permitted yes, if policy does not cover personal user or ownership of data, no. It should be extended to cover Network also.</body></html>
