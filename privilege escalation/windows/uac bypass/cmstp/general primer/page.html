<br/>
The strange thing is that this executable is not supposed to “auto elevate”.<br/>
Also, if we check the integrity level of the process we can confirm that it is not elevated by default and is running in medium integrity level<br/>
Using 'sendkeys', CMSTP can be automated. How about automated loading of an attacker profile?!<br/>
Microsoft have implemented security measures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Interface_Privilege_Isolation">UIPI</a>) in the past to prevent sendkey attacks so I am amazed that this works. I think it is a little cool at least<br/>
The reason is autoelevated COM interface CMLUAUTIL from cmlua.dll, it has ShellExec and some more methods which also maybe out of interest. I think you can just run methods from this interface directly without “sendkeys”<br/>
