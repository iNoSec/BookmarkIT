<title>Threat Agents/Community Analysis</title>
</head><body>== Threat Agents/Community Analysis ==<br/>
When defining the relevant threat communities and agents, a clear identification of the threat should be provided in terms of location (internal / external to the organization), the specific community within the location, and any additional relevant information that would assist in establishing a capabilities/motivation profile for the specific agent/community.<br/>
Where possible, specific agents should be identified. Otherwise, a more general community should be outlined, along-with any supporting material and intelligence.<br/>
Some examples of threat agent/community classifications are:<br/>
