</head><body>Dealing with Shunning<br/>
There are times where shunning is perfectly acceptable and there are times where it may not fit the spirit of the test. For example, if your test is to be a full black-box test where you are testing not only the technology, but the capabilities of the target organizationâ€™s security team, shunning would be perfectly fine. However, when you are testing a large number of systems in coordination with the target organization's security team it may not be in the best interests of the test to shun your attacks.</body></html>
