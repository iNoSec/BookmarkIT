<title>SMB Magic</title>
</head><body>So, as it turns out the newer versions of Samba have the ability to replicate from a domain controller and then you can convert that into a huge keytab.<br/>
<br/>
To use this 'feature' you need a newer version of Samba. This means compiling from scratch. Beyond the scope of what I'm writing about here, but it wasn't hard. Couple annoying dependencies and some multi-core compiling later I have a new build in /opt/smb.<br/>
<br/>
This magical command is called 'samba-tool'. You can use it to replicate a remote DC (with an admin user of course) and it will dump the contents to a directory of your choosing. Plus you can use Kerberos, so you can simply use an existing ticket you received from OPTH. <br/>
<br/>
amba-tool drs clone-dc-database --include-secrets --targetdir=&lt;dir&gt; &lt;DOMAIN in CAPS&gt; -k1 <br/>
<br/>
You need to specify 'targetdir' and the domain obviously. The '-k1' tells it to use kerberos. My test domain has a large number of objects (computers / users/ groups ) that I created using Joeware's admod to give it some size.<br/>
<br/>
So, this scrolls on for a bit until it's pumped the DC dry. The next step takes the data from here and generates a keytab file with everything in it. Note this step takes a long time. On my machine it took a few hours. There might be a way to optimize things a tad if you don't want everything.<br/>
<br/>
Anywhoo... without further ado:<br/>
<br/>
samba-tool domain exportkeytab &lt;filename&gt; -s &lt;path to configfile&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Note that the new keytab can be whatever you want it to be, however the config file was actually generated by the previous command. Like I said earlier, this command takes a while for my largish domain, but I ended up with a keytab file with all keys (AES, NTLM, DES) from the domain. And in a much more compact format. My combined file for the domain is ~6meg.<br/>
<br/>
You can list the keys contained in a keytab file using ktutil and can even get the actual keys themselves if you tack on '--keys'. </body></html>
