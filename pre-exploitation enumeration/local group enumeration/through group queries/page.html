Get-NetLocalGroup<br/>
For some quick review, Get-NetLocalGroup utilizes the Active Directory Service Interfaces [ADSI] WinNT provider to query the members of a local group (default of ‘Administrators’) from a remote machine. We can pull not just group member names, but whether the member is a group or user, whether the account is disabled, the account’s last login time, the account SID, and more. With the SID we can also determine if the result is a local account/group or a domain account as well. And what’s really cool is that we can query all of this information as an unprivileged domain user context (though you do need a domain authenticated account).<br/>
<br/>
An example we run often is Get-NetDomainController | Get-NetLocalGroup to see what users can compromise the domain controllers in an environment. One sometimes confusing point is that these results for a domain controller are NOT just the members of the ‘Domain Admins’ group, but rather the members of the Administrators BUILTIN container on the DC. While ‘Domain Admins’ will be a part of the result set, you’ll sometimes find additional groups and users that have local administrative rights on a DC. These make excellent targets for later user hunting.<br/>

If you’re on a shorter timeframe pentest, and want to run this functionality on ALL machines in the network, you can execute Invoke-EnumerateLocalAdmin [-OutFile admins.csv] (with optional -Threads X for threaded functionality). </body></html>
