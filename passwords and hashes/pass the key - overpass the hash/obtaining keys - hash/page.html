<title>Obtaining Keys / Hash</title>
</head><body>Keys are <b>both</b>in Active Directory and client LSASS memory<br/>
<br/>
We can find:<br/>
	DES key<br/>
	RC4 key (this is the NTLM hash of the password, no domain salt!)<br/>
	AES128 and AES 256 keys (with NT 6)<br/>
<br/>
New &quot;Protected Users&quot; group prevents keys in client <b>LSASS</b>memory<br/>
	Of course not on the DC itself<br/>
<br/>
AES Keys use PBKDF2<br/>
	These hashes are salted<br/>
	4096 iterations of the PBKDF2 algorithm<br/>
	Difficult to crack<br/>
<br/>
Of course these hashes are cached in memory on the client side and then used as password equivs, just like NT hashes<br/>
This is how you fail with strong cryptography<br/>
