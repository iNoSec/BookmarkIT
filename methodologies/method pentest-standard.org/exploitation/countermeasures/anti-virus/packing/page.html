<br/>
Packing is similar to encoding in a sense in that it attempts to re-arrange data to compress the application or &quot;pack&quot; it. The hopes of this is that the executable or piece of code being delivered is obfuscated in a manner that it won't be picked up by anti-virus technologies.</body></html>
