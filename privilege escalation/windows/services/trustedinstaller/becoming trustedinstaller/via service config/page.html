<title>Via Service Config</title>
</head><body>Therefore, the quick and dirty way would be to change the configuration of the TI service to run a different binary. Oddly, even though TI makes things on the system harder to mess with, it doesnâ€™t protect its own service configuration from modification by a normal administrator. So you can issue a command such as the following to delete an arbitrary file as TI:<br/>
<br/>
sc config TrustedInstaller binPath= &quot;cmd.exe /C del path\to\file&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Start the TI service and *bang* the file is gone. Another reason this works is TI is not a Protected Process Light (PPL), which is odd because the TI group is given special permission to stop and delete PPL services. </body></html>
