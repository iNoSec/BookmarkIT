<title>Blind</title>
</head><body>Normal Blind, You can not see a response in the page, but you can still determine result of a query from response or HTTP status code <br/>
In normal blinds you can use if statements or abuse WHERE query in injection (generally easier).<br/>
<br/>
Totally Blind, You can not see any difference in the output in any kind. This can be an injection a logging function or similar. Not so common, though. In total blinds you need to use some waiting functions and analyze response times. For this you can use WAIT FOR DELAY '0:0:10' in SQL Server, BENCHMARK() and sleep(10) in MySQL, pg_sleep(10) in PostgreSQL, and some PL/SQL tricks in ORACLE.<br/>
<br/>
First of all use this if it's really blind, otherwise just use 1/0 style errors to identify difference. Second, be careful while using times more than 20-30 seconds. database API connection or script can be timeout.<br/>
