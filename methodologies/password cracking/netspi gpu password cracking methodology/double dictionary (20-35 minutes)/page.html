<title>Double dictionary (20-35 minutes*)</title>
</head><body>At this point, we’re hitting our limits and need to start getting creative. Along with our hefty primary dictionary, we have a number of shorter dictionaries that are small enough that we can combine them to catch repeaters (e.g. “P@ssword P@ssword“). The attack is pretty simple: a word from the first dictionary will be appended with a word from the second.<br/>
<br/>
This style of attack is known as the combinator attack and is run with the -a 1 mode of oclHashcat. Additional rules can be applied to each dictionary to catch some common word delineation patterns (“Super-Secret!“). The example here would append a dash to the first word and an exclamation mark to the second.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, this did not work for this sample set. Normally, we catch a few with this and it can be really handy in some scenarios, but that was not the case here.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we will (typically) be about an hour into our cracking process. From the uniqued sample set, we were able to crack 530 of the 828 hashes (64%) within one hour. From the complete set (including duplicates), we were able to crack 701 of the 1,000 total hashes (70.1%).</body></html>
