<title>Technique 2 NamedPipe DLL</title>
</head><body>/*<br/>
* Elevate from local admin to local system via Named Pipe Impersonation. We spawn a service under local <br/>
* system which then connects to our named pipe and we impersonate this client. This can be done by an <br/>
* Administrator without the need for SeDebugPrivilege, however a dll (elevator.dll) must be written to <br/>
* disk. Works on NT4, 2000, XP, 2003 and 2008 for all local administrators. On Vista and 7 it <b>will only <br/>
</b><b>* work if the host process has been elevated through UAC first.</b><br/>
