</head><body>Microsoft Digest SSP. Microsoft Digest is a security support provider (SSP) that implements the Digest Access protocol, a lightweight authentication protocol for parties involved in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) based communications<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft Digest provides a simple challenge response mechanism for authenticating clients. This SSP is intended for use by client/server applications using HTTP or SASL based communications.<br/>
Important Digest authentication is not supported across forests.<br/>
<br/>
The following sections provide information about Microsoft Digest SSP.<br/>

We also have a few options for the enumeration and abuse of SSP Authentication Packages. get_ssps and install_ssp (again from PowerSploit) allow you to enumerate and install malicious SSPs on the target system. @pyrotek3 has some more information on how to abuse these methods on his blog. There’s also <a href="https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/Empire/blob/master/lib/modules/persistence/misc/memssp.py">memssp</a>from @gentilkiwi, weaponized through PowerSploit’s Invoke-Mimikatz function. This executes Mimikatz’ misc::memssp function to log all user authentication events to C:\Windows\System32\mimisla.log. Note that this particular method is memory-resident only and won’t survive a reboot, and requires administrative privileges.<br/>
