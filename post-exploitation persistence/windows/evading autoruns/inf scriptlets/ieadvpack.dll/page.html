<title>IEadvpack.dll</title>
</head><body>While searching for interesting DLL functions, I came across a duplicate entry for LaunchINFSection. <br/>
As previously analyzed this is the lead in function to invoke with rundll32/advpack.dll. <br/>
It was then that I discovered IEadvpack.dll<br/>
<br/>
I tested this finding with this very similar command:<br/>
<br/>
rundll32.exe ieadvpack.dll,LaunchINFSection test.inf,,1,<br/>
<br/>
As expected, the INF-SCT execution is successful!<br/>
*Note: Like Advpack.dll, IEadvpack.dll/LaunchINFSection can bypass Default AppLocker Rules.</body></html>
