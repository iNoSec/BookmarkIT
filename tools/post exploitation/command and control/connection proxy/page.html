<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Phreebird is a DNSSEC proxy that operates in front of an existing DNS server (such as BIND, Unbound, PowerDNS, Microsoft DNS, or QIP) and supplements its records with DNSSEC responses. Features of Phreebird include automatic key generation, realtime record signing, support for arbitrary responses, zero configuration, NSEC3 -White Lies-, caching and rate limiting to deter DoS attacks, and experimental support for both Coarse Time over DNS and HTTP Virtual Channels. The suite also contains a large amount of sample code, including support for federated identity over OpenSSH. Finally, -Phreeload- enhances existing OpenSSL applications with DNSSEC support.</li>

<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>This tool provides a demonstration of the HTTPS stripping attacks that I presented at Black Hat DC 2009. It will transparently hijack HTTP traffic on a network, watch for HTTPS links and redirects, then map those links into either look-alike HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS links. It also supports modes for supplying a favicon which looks like a lock icon, selective logging, and session denial.</li>

<ul><ul><ul>Echo Mirage is a generic network proxy. It uses DLL injection and function hooking techniques to redirect network related function calls so that data transmitted and received by local applications can be observed and modified. Windows encryption and OpenSSL functions are also hooked so that plain text of data being sent and received over an encrypted session is also available. Traffic can be intercepted in real-time, or manipulated with regular expressions and a number of action directives</ul>
