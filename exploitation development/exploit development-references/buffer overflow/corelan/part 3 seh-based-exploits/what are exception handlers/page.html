<title>What Are Exception Handlers</title>
</head><body>An exception handler is a piece of code that is written inside an application, with the purpose of dealing with the fact that the application throws an execption. A typical exception handler looks like this :<br/>
<br/>
try<br/>
{<br/>
 //run stuff. If an exception occurs, go to code<br/>
}<br/>
catch<br/>
{<br/>
 // run stuff when exception occurs<br/>
}<br/>
A quick look on the stack on how the try &amp; catch blocks are related to each other and placed on the stack :<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image.png"/><br/>
(Note : &quot;Address of exception handler&quot; is just one part of a SEH record – the image above is an abstract representation, merely showing the various components)<br/>
<br/>
Windows has a default SEH (Structured Exception Handler) which will catch exceptions. If Windows catches an exception, you’ll see a “xxx has encountered a problem and needs to close” popup. This is often the result of the default handler kicking in. It is obvious that, in order to write stable software, one should try to use development language specific exception handlers, and only rely on the windows default SEH as a last resort. When using language EH’s, the necessary links and calls to the exception handling code are generate in accordance with the underlying OS. (and when no exception handlers are used, or when the available exception handlers cannot process the exception, the Windows SEH will be used. (UnhandledExceptionFilter)). So in the event an error or illegal instruction occurs, the application will get a chance to catch the exception and do something with it. If no exception handler is defined in the application, the OS takes over, catches the exception, shows the popup (asking you to Send Error Report to MS).<br/>
<br/>
In order for the application to be able to go to the catch code, the pointer to the exception handler code is saved on the stack (for each code block). Each code block has its own stack frame, and the pointer to the exception handler is part of this stack frame. In other words : Each function/procedure gets a stack frame. If an exception handler is implement in this function/procedure, the exception handler gets its own stack frame. Information about the frame-based exception handler is stored in an exception_registration structure on the stack.<br/>
<br/>
This structure ( also called a SEH record) is 8 bytes and has 2 (4 byte) elements :<br/>
<ul><li>a pointer to the next exception_registration structure (in essence, to the next SEH record, in case the current handler is unable the handle the exception)</li>
<li>a pointer, the address of the actual code of the exception handler. (SE Handler)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Simple stack view on the SEH chain components :<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 2.png"/><br/>
<br/>
At the top of the main data block (the data block of the application’s “main” function, or TEB (Thread Environment Block) / TIB (Thread Information Block)), a pointer to the top of the SEH chain is placed. This SEH chain is often called the FS:[0] chain as well.<br/>
<br/>
So, on Intel machines, when looking at the disassembled SEH code, you will see an instruction to move DWORD ptr from FS:[0]. This ensures that the exception handler is set up for the thread and will be able to catch errors when they occur. The opcode for this instruction is 64A100000000. If you cannot find this opcode, the application/thread may not have exception handling at all.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can use a OllyDBG plugin called OllyGraph to create a Function Flowchart.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom of the SEH chain is indicated by FFFFFFFF. This will trigger an improper termination of the program (and the OS handler will kick in)<br/>
<br/>
Quick example : compile the following source code (sehtest.exe) and open the executable in windbg. Do NOT start the application yet, leave it in a paused state :<br/>
<br/>
#include<br/>
#include&lt;string.h&gt;<br/>
#include<br/>
<br/>
int ExceptionHandler(void);<br/>
int main(int argc,char *argv[]){<br/>
<br/>
char temp[512];<br/>
<br/>
printf(&quot;Application launched&quot;);<br/>
<br/>
__try {<br/>
<br/>
  strcpy(temp,argv[1]);<br/>
<br/>
  } __except ( ExceptionHandler() ){<br/>
}<br/>
return 0;<br/>
}<br/>
int ExceptionHandler(void){<br/>
printf(&quot;Exception&quot;);<br/>
return 0;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
look at the loaded modules<br/>
<br/>
Executable search path is:<br/>
ModLoad: 00400000 0040c000  	c:\sploits\seh\lcc\sehtest.exe<br/>

ModLoad: 73d90000 73db7000  	C:\WINDOWS\system32\CRTDLL.DLL<br/>
<br/>
The application sits between 00400000 and 0040c000<br/>
<br/>
Search this area for the opcode :<br/>

This is proof that an exception handler is registered. <br/>

The pointer points to 0x<span style="color: #ff0000">0012fd0c</span>(begin of SEH chain). When looking at that area, we see :<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000">ff ff ff ff</span>indicates the end of the SEH chain. That’s normal, because the application is not started yet. (Windbg is still paused)<br/>
<br/>
If you have the Ollydbg plugin Ollygraph installed, you could open the executable in ollydbg and create the graph, which should indicate if an exception handler is installed or not :<br/>

The TEB for the main function is now set up. The SEH chain for the main function points at 0x<span style="color: #ff0000">0012ff40</span>, where the exception handler is listed and will point to the exception handler function (0x<span style="color: #0000ff">0012ffb0</span>)<br/>
<br/>
In OllyDbg, you can see the seh chain more easily :<br/>
<br/>

(There is a similar view in Immunity Debugger – just click &quot;View&quot; and select &quot;SEH Chain&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Stack :<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 5.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Here we can see a pointer to our Exception Handler function ExceptionHandler() (0x0040109A)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, as you can see in the explanation above the example, and in the last screenshot, exception handlers are connected/linked to each other. They form a linked list chain on the stack, and sit relatively close to the bottom of the stack. (SEH chain). When an exception occurs, Windows ntdll.dll kicks in, retrieves the head of the SEH chain (sits at the top of TEB/TIB remember), walks through the list and tries to find the suitable handler. If no handler is found the default Win32 handler will be used (at the bottom of the stack, the one after FFFFFFFF).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 6.png"/><br/>
<br/>
We see the first SE Handler record at 0012FFF40. The next SEH address points to the next SEH record (0012FFB0). The current handler points at 7C839AD8. It looks like this is some kind of OS handler (the pointers points into an OS module)<br/>
<br/>
Then, the second SEH record entry in the chain (at 0012FFB0) has the following values: next SEH points to 0012FFE0. The handler points at 0040109A. This address is part of the executable (within application memory range), so it looks like this is an application handler.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the last SEH record in the chain (at 0012FFE0) has FFFFFFFF in nseh. This means that this is the last entry in the chain. The handler points at 7C839AD8, which is an OS handler again.<br/>
<br/>
So, putting all pieces together, the entire SEH chain looks like this :<br/>
<br/>
