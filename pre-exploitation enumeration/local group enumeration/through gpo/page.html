<title>Through GPO</title>
</head><body>It is possible to map what machines a specific user or group has local administrator (or RDP) rights on a pc by correlating GPO, OU, and user membership data. This approach has the advantage of no communication with a target system, as it only queries your primary (or specified) domain controller for the relevant information. I’ll walk through this process step by step and show how some of PowerView’s weaponized functions take care of this for you.<br/>
<br/>
Get-NetGPOGroup is where everything starts. It will enumerate all current GPOs with Get-NetGPO and will parse any GptTmpl.inf files (located at “$GPOPath\MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf”) and any Groups.xml files (located at “$GPOPath\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml”). GptTmpl.inf is used by Group Policy to set ‘Restricted Groups’, i.e. what users are members of specific local groups on machines where the policy is applied. Groups.xml is used by Group Policy Preferences to perform similar task. <br/>
<br/>
You can see above that Members contains the security identifiers of users/groups we’re interested in, and the MemberOf field specifies their local group membership (in this case ‘Administrators’, with well known SIDs <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/243330">documented here</a>). If we combine this information with the complete group membership of a target user to identify what GPOs set local group membership for our target user, and then find linked OUs and resulting computers similar to how we enumerated GPP, we can get machines our target can access with only sending traffic to our domain controller.<br/>
<br/>
Find-GPOLocation will do just that, taking a specified -UserName &lt;USER&gt; or -GroupName &lt;GROUP&gt; and returning the set of computers they can access. If a user or group name is not specified, all relationships for the domain will be returned. Also, a different -LocalGroup can be specified (default of ‘Administrators’).<br/>
<br/>
Here’s how it works:<ul><li>Retrieve the SID for the specified user or group name.</li>
<li>Enumerate all groups the user/group is currently a part of by invoking Get-NetGroup -UserName X which will retrieve membership from the tokenGroups attribute. Use this to build a list of target SIDs of all groups the target is a member of.</li>
<li>Enumerate all GPOs that set ‘Restricted Groups’ or Groups.xml by calling Get-NetGPOGroup.</li>
<li>Matching the target SID list to the queried GPO SID list to enumerate all GPOs the target is effectively applied with.</li>
<li>Enumerate all OUs and sites that any resulting GPOs by linking the GPO GUID with the gplink attribute.</li>
<li>Query for any computers in resulting OUs and return any resulting sites.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There’s also a functional inverse, Find-GPOComputerAdmin, that will return what objects have membership for a specified -LocalGroup on a target system. The -Recurse flag will resolve the membership of any results that are a group themselves.<br/>
<br/>
And just like Get-NetLocalGroup, these functions don’t need elevated access to query this information. However, Find-GPOComputerAdmin will only return domain results, i.e. local user accounts will not be returned.</body></html>
