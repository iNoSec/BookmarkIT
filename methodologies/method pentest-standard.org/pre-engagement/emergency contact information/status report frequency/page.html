<title>Status Report Frequency</title>
</head><body>Status Report Frequency<br/>
The frequency of status reporting can vary widely. Some factors which influence the reporting schedule include the overall length of the test, the test scope, and the targetâ€™s security maturity. An effective schedule allows the customer to feel engaged. An ignored customer is a former customer.<br/>
<br/>
Once frequency and schedule of status reports has been set, it must be fulfilled. Postponing or delaying a status report may be necessary, but it should not become chronic. The client may be asked to agree to a new schedule if necessary. Skipping a status report altogether is unprofessional and should be avoided if at all possible</body></html>
