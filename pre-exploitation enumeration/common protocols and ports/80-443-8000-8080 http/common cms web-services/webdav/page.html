<title>Webdav</title>
</head><body>Okay so webdav is old as hell, and not used very often. It is pretty much like ftp. But you go through http to access it. So if you have webdav installed on a xamp-server you can access it like this:<br/>
cadaver 192.168.1.101/webdav<br/>
Then sign in with username and password. The default username and passwords on xamp are:<br/>
Username: wampp<br/>
Password: xampp<br/>
<br/>
Then use put and get to upload and download. With this you can of course upload a shell that gives you better access.<br/>
If you are looking for live examples just google this:<br/>
inurl:webdav site:com<br/>
<br/>
Test if it is possible to upload and execute files with webdav.<br/>
davtest -url http://192.168.1.101 -directory demo_dir -rand aaaa_upfileP0C<br/>
<br/>
If you managed to gain access but is unable to execute code there is a workaround for that! So if webdav has prohibited the user to upload .asp code, and pl and whatever, we can do this:<br/>
upload a file called shell443.txt, which of course is your .asp shell. And then you rename it to shell443.asp;.jpg. Now you visit the page in the browser and the asp code will run and return your shell.<br/>
