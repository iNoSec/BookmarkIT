<title>Gateway Ports</title>
</head><body>GatewayPorts<br/>
    Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local<br/>
    forwarded ports. By default, ssh(1) binds local port forwardings<br/>
    to the loopback address. This prevents other remote hosts from<br/>
    connecting to forwarded ports. GatewayPorts can be used to spec‐<br/>
    ify that ssh should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard<br/>
    address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded<br/>
    ports. The argument must be “yes” or “no”. The default is “no”.<br/>
<br/>
And you can use localhost instead of M in the forwarding, as you're forwarding to the same machine as you're SSH-ing to -- if I understand your question correctly.<br/>
<br/>
So, the command will become this:<br/>
<br/>
ssh -L 2222:localhost:8888 -N -o GatewayPorts=yes hostname-of-M<br/>
<br/>
and will look like this in netstat -nltp:<br/>
tcp    0   0  0.0.0.0:2222  0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 5113/ssh<br/>
<br/>
Now anyone accessing this machine at port 2222 TCP will actually talk to localhost:8888 as seen in machine M. Note that this is not the same as plain forwarding to port 8888 of M.<br/>
<br/>
Local SSH has the -g option<br/>
Remote SSH you have to set GatewayPorts yes in ssh config</body></html>
