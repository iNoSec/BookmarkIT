<title>sdclt Hijack</title>
</head><body>Similar to the EventVwr Hijack, this bypass takess advantage of a command being run from a registry path<br/>
<br/>
Looking at sdclt.exe in IDA, it checks if the argument matches “/kickoffelev”. If it does, it sets the full path for “sdclt.exe”, adds “/KickOffJob” as a parameter and then calls SxShellExecuteWithElevate.<br/>
Following that path, SxShellExecuteWithElevate starts “%systemroot%\system32\sdclt.exe /kickoffjob” with the “Runas” <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc144175(v=vs.85).aspx">verb</a>.<br/>
The next step is to run “sdclt.exe /Kickoffelev” with procmon running. After going through the output, we see the trusty “shell\&lt;verb&gt;\command” registry search path in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive. <br/>
Nothing happens, but looking back in procmon, our keys are queried, but sdclt.exe is actually looking for an additional value within the “command” key: “IsolatedCommand”.<br/>
We can then add our payload and parameters in a string (REG_SZ) value within the “Command” key called “IsolatedCommand”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the same bug (minus the IsolatedCommand portion) that was used in the eventvwr.exe “fileless” UAC bypass. You can read about the eventvwr.exe bypass and the specific registry keys used <a href="https://enigma0x3.net/2016/08/15/fileless-uac-bypass-using-eventvwr-exe-and-registry-hijacking/">here</a>. Notice that instead of “shell\open\command”, we now see “shell\runas\command”. This is because sdclt.exe was invoked (again) using the “RunAs” verb via SxShellExecuteWithElevate. <br/>
<br/>
After adding our payload as the “IsolatedCommand” value, running “sdclt.exe /KickOffElev” will execute our payload (and any parameters) in a high-integrity context<br/>
<br/>
This version of sdclt bypass can accept arguments on command line, so no need for a file :P<br/>
<br/>
This particular technique can be remediated or fixed by setting the UAC level to “Always Notify” or by removing the current user from the Local Administrators group. Further, if you would like to monitor for this attack, you could utilize methods/signatures to look for and alert on new registry entries in <b>HKCU:\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand</b><br/>
