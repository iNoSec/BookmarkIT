</head><body>NTLM Relaying explained<br/>
NTLM Authentication is a challenge-response based protocol. Challenge-response protocols use a commonly shared secret, in this case the user password, to authenticate the client. The server sends a challenge, and the client replies with the response on this challenge. If the challenge matches the one calculated by the server, the authentication is accepted. The NTLM Authentication is a complex protocol, and how it is explained here is a simplification. A very good and detailed description can be found at <a href="http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html">http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Abusing NTLM<br/>
As an attacker, this process can be abused if a client can be convinced to connect to an attacker. How this can be done is explained in the next section. Once an attacker has a connected client willing to authenticate, they can easily forward the 3 messages to the server between client and the server until the challenge-response cycle is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Cross protocol relaying<br/>
The NTLM authentication is encapsulated within other protocols, but the messages are the same regardless of the overlying protocol. This allows for using the NTLM messages in other protocols. For example a client that authenticates using HTTP sends the NTLM authentication messages within the “Authorization” header. An attacker can take these messages out of the HTTP header and use them in other protocols, such as SMB.<br/>
<br/>
NTLM is supported in several protocols, for example SMB, HTTP(S), LDAP, IMAP, SMTP, POP3 and MSSQL.</body></html>
