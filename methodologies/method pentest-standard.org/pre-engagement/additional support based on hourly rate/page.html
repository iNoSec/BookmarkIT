</head><body>Additional Support Based on Hourly Rate<br/>
Anything that is not explicitly covered within the scope of the engagement should be handled very carefully. The first reason for this is scope creep. As the scope expands, resources are consumed, cutting into the profits for the tester and may even create confusion and anger on the part of the customer. There is another issue that many testers do not think of when taking on additional work on an ad-hoc basis: legal ramifications. Many ad-hoc requests are not properly documented so it can be difficult to determine who said what in the event of a dispute or legal action. Further, the contract is a legal document specifying the work that is to be done. It should be tightly tied to the permission to test memo.<br/>
<br/>
Any requests outside of the original scope should be documented in the form of a statement of work that clearly identifies the work to be done. We also recommend that it be clearly stated in the contract that additional work will be done for a flat fee per hour and explicitly state that additional work can not be completed until a signed and counter-signed SOW is in place.</body></html>
