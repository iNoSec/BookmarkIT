<title>IEexpress</title>
</head><body>IExpress.exe is a utility for creating self-extracting installation packages and has been bundled with the Windows since (at least) the release of Windows 2000. As I recently discovered, it is still included in Windows 10 and Windows 2016, respectfully. IExpress can be invoked as a command line tool (with switches) or launched independently as a step-through wizard.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, IExpress can bundle a single INF file (that contains the appropriate directive to call the SCT) by adding it to the list of files for packaging. After stepping through the wizard, a self-extracting directive (SED) file and a resulting compressed executable file are created (Note: the SED file is optional). Invoking the executable via command line or the GUI will launch the bundled INF for payload.<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to the CMSTP profile creation tool, which will generate an inf, sed, and iexpress exe among other files.<br/>
<br/>
In command line mode, IExpress can create the same executable with a properly configured SED:<br/>
<br/>
iexpress.exe /n [path to file.sed]<br/>
*Note: The payload executable created by IExpress.exe is not signed.</body></html>
