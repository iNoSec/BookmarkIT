<title>Ping</title>
</head><body># Simple ICMP ping.<br/>
#<br/>
# This implementation of ping uses the ICMP echo and echo-reply packets<br/>
# to check the status of a host. If the remote host is up, it should reply<br/>
# to the echo probe with an echo-reply packet.<br/>
# Note that this isn't a definite test, as in the case the remote host is up<br/>
# but refuses to reply the probes.<br/>
# Also note that the user must have special access to be able to open a raw<br/>
# socket, which this program requires.<br/>
