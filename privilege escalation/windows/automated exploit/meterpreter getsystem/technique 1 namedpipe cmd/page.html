/*<br/>
* Worker thread for named pipe impersonation. Creates a named pipe and impersonates <br/>
* the first client which connects to it.<br/>
*/<br/>
Creates a named pipe for the client service to connect to:<br/>
	hServerPipe = CreateNamedPipe( cpServicePipe, PIPE_ACCESS_DUPLEX, PIPE_TYPE_MESSAGE|PIPE_WAIT, 2, 0, 0, 0, NULL );<br/>
Wait for the client to connect to the named pipe<br/>
Read the pipe<br/>
Impersonate the client<br/>
Set the merterpreters thread token to that of the system token so all subsequent meterpreter threads use it<br/>
<br/>
/*<br/>
* Elevate from local admin to local system via Named Pipe Impersonation. We spawn a cmd.exe under local <br/>
* system which then connects to our named pipe and we impersonate this client. This can be done by an <br/>
* Administrator without the need for SeDebugPrivilege. Works on 2000, XP, 2003 and 2008 for all local <br/>
* administrators. On Vista and 7 it will only work if the host process has been elevated through UAC<br/>
* first. Does not work on NT4.<br/>
*/<br/>
Filter out Windows NT4 (not supported)<br/>
spawn cmd as SYSTEM<br/>
cmd.exe /c echo data to pipe<br/>
Start the elevator service<br/>
Impersonate SYSTEM</body></html>
