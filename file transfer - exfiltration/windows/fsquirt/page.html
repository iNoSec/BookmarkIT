The Bluetooth File Transfer Wizard enables users to transfer files between a computer and a Bluetooth device. For example, users can transfer files between a computer and a mobile phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA). The Bluetooth File Transfer Wizard can also transfer files between two computers that support Bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
Note The default GUI that the Bluetooth File Transfer Wizard uses is implemented in the Fsquirt.exe file. This file can be unhooked from the underlying transfer wizard mechanism to enable replacement of the default Bluetooth File Transfer Wizard GUI. For more information, see the following question.<br/>

</b>The first time I ran across the use of the Windows native fsquirt.exe utility, I found an entry for the utility in the user's MUICache data. The path pointed to the file in the system32 folder, which, after an initial investigation, appeared to be correct. I then found a Prefetch file for the utility, as well. The utility is actually a wizard with a GUI, and as such, uses common dialogs to allow the user to select files to send to device; analysis of values in the ComDlg32\OpenSavePidlMRU key provided indications of files that might have been copied to the device.</body></html>
