<title>Invoke-MapDomainTrusts</title>
</head><body>Invoke-MapDomainTrusts is a capability built to crawl and enumerate the trust relationships from your current Domain. Essentially, this builds you a map of all the places you have a knowledge about from your current location. It recursively queries all the domains that it finds for this information. The command will dump out a CSV of all domain trusts that it was able to enumerate. For two fictitious companies, Bob’s Auto and Alice’s Tire Shop where Alice’s shop must access resources from Bob’s, the output might look something like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;bob.com&quot;,&quot;finance.bob.com&quot;,&quot;ParentChild&quot;,&quot;BiDirectional&quot;<br/>
&quot;bob.com&quot;,&quot;corp.bob.com&quot;,&quot;ParentChild&quot;,&quot;BiDirectional&quot;<br/>
&quot;corp.bob.com&quot;,&quot;corp.alice.com&quot;,&quot;External&quot;,&quot;Inbound&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With an engagement against a large corporation, this output would be massive and incomprehensible. You could spend day’s searching it trying to piece together something useful.</body></html>
