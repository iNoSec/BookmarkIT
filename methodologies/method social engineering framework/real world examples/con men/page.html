<title>Con Men</title>
</head><body>A con man is described as person who swindles or misleads his victims through the use of a confidence game. Human nature leads us to naturally want to trust other individuals. Social Engineering is based on this principal and as an extension a Con Man is able to manipulate this trust for personal gain. Most of the historically infamous Con Men are known for their exploits involving money. Money seems to be a common thread with the vast majority of Con Men.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Examples of Confidence Men and Confidence Scams</b> <br/>
<br/>
The FBI website breaks down some of the common types of scams. The following list is an example of a few of the most well known genres of confidence scams and some people that became notorious for applying them.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Pyramid Scheme</b> <br/>
<br/>
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions, in the classic “pyramid” scheme, participants attempt to make money solely by recruiting new participants into the program. The hallmark of these schemes is the promise of sky-high returns in a short period of time for doing nothing other than handing over your money and getting others to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Charles Ponzi<br/>
An example of this type of scheme and how devastating it can be is found in the story of Charles Ponzi . This article published on the Solutions Risque Website discusses how Charles Ponzi affected US History with his con. Ponzi’s con was so significant, that the pyramid scheme is now commonly referred to as a “Ponzi Scheme”. Ponzi promised his early investors an almost unbelievable 50% return on their investments. He did this by taking money from new clients to pay back the originals. Ponzi was actually able to pay back the returns for his early tier customers but was not able to pay his new clients back.<br/>
<br/>
Bernard Madoff<br/>
Bernard Madoff became infamous for scamming millions of dollars from thousands of his customers, friends and relatives. He used and improved on Ponzis’ model to generate huge investment returns for his early clients while bringing in new money from new clients. Madoff was essentially “Stealing from Peter and paying Paul”. An analysis and commentary on Bernie Madoff’s sophisticated Ponzi scheme can be found in this article published April 20, 2017 from the CFA Institute<br/>

<b>Nigerian Scams</b> <br/>
<br/>
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions, one type of advance fee fraud is known as a Nigerian “Advance Fee Fraud.” In these schemes, someone pretending to be a Nigerian official or business-person asks ordinary individuals and companies to help move millions of dollars out of Nigeria in exchange for high, hassle-free profits. The fraudsters solicit investors through mass mailings, faxes, phone calls, and e-mails.<br/>

Victor Lustig is known as the “Man who sold the Eiffel Tower”. Much like his American counterpart Parker, Lustig famously “sold” the Eiffel Tower to a scrap metal dealer in France. He is also famous for scamming Al Capone. He “convinced” Al Capone to invest $50,000 with him. He stored the money in a vault and returned it two months later, stating that the deal had fallen through. Capone, so impressed by Lustig’s honesty gave him $5,000 for his effort.<br/>
