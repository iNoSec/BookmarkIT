DESCRIPTION<br/>
This tool is part of the <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/samba.7.html">samba(7)</a>suite.<br/>
nmblookup is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP queries. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine. All queries are done over UDP.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The command<br/>
<br/>
 nmblookup -A IP_address<br/>
<br/>
returns, according to the man page, a node status query on this address. A typical output is:<br/>
<br/>
 Looking up status of 192.168.253.101<br/>
  HPB4B52F0559C2 	&lt;00&gt; -     		B &lt;ACTIVE&gt; &lt;PERMANENT&gt; <br/>
  MSHOME     		&lt;00&gt; - &lt;GROUP&gt; 	B &lt;ACTIVE&gt; &lt;PERMANENT&gt; <br/>
  HPB4B52F0559C2 	&lt;20&gt; -     		B &lt;ACTIVE&gt; &lt;PERMANENT&gt; <br/>
  HP0559C2    		&lt;00&gt; -     		B &lt;ACTIVE&gt; &lt;PERMANENT&gt; <br/>
  HP0559C2    		&lt;20&gt; -     		B &lt;ACTIVE&gt; &lt;PERMANENT&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each line corresponds to a <i>name</i>that the node has claimed using NetBIOS.<br/>
<ul><li>The first field is the name itself.</li>
<li>The second field is the <a href="http://ubiqx.org/cifs/Appendix-C.html">suffix</a>, or the 16th byte of the name, in hexadecimal. It shows the <i>type</i>of this name – 0x00 is &quot;Workstation&quot; (a regular NetBIOS node), 0x20 is &quot;Server&quot; (a node running a SMB file server), 0x01 is &quot;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc751403.aspx">Browser</a>&quot; (a node that keeps track of all NetBIOS names on the network), 0x03 is &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Messenger_service">Messenger</a>&quot; (a node <i>or a user</i>that can receive popup notifications), and so on, and so on.</li>
<li>The third field is unknown to me yet...</li>
<li>The fourth field marks this line as a &quot;group&quot; name – one that multiple node (AFAIK up to 16) may claim at once. In this case, a group name of type 0x00 (Workstation) denotes the <i>workgroup</i>that the node is in (which again has to do with <a href="http://ubiqx.org/cifs/Browsing.html">network browsing</a>).</li>
<li>The fifth field is the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/119493">node type</a>(though I don't know why it is a property of each name – AFAIK, it is a setting of the node itself…) – B-nodes use NetBIOS datagrams which are broadcast in the LAN; P-nodes (point-to-point) use a central WINS server; M-nodes (mixed) first try broadcast then WINS when resolving names; H-nodes (hybrid), a later improvement over M-node, first try WINS then broadcast (this is a little faster).</li>
<li>I am not sure of the last two fields. It's likely that &lt;ACTIVE&gt; means that the node successfully registered this name; if it ended up a duplicate, it would still be listed in response to a status query, but it would have a different marker. Similarly, &lt;PERMANENT&gt; is likely to mean that the name doesn't expire, or something.</li>
</ul>
