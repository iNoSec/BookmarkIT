</head><body>One thing we have not yet mentioned is that QueueUserApc only works on threads that are in an alertable state. How does a thread enter an alertable state?<br/>
<br/>
According to Microsoft:<br/>
<br/>
“””<br/>
<br/>
A thread can only do this by calling one of the following functions with the appropriate flags:<br/>
<ul><li>SleepEx</li>
<li>WaitForSingleObjectEx</li>
<li>WaitForMultipleObjectsEx</li>
<li>SignalObjectAndWait</li>
<li>MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx</li>
</ul>
<br/>
When the thread enters an alertable state, the following events occur:<br/>
<ul><li>The kernel checks the thread’s APC queue. If the queue contains callback function pointers, the kernel removes the pointer from the queue and sends it to the thread.</li>
<li>The thread executes the callback function.</li>
<li>Steps 1 and 2 are repeated for each pointer remaining in the queue.</li>
<li>When the queue is empty, the thread returns from the function that placed it in an alertable state.</li>
</ul>

<br/>
For our technique to be effective the target process must have at least one thread that is in an alertable state, or will enter an alertable state at some point, otherwise our APCs will never actually execute.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve checked various software, and I’ve noticed that most of the programs I’ve checked have at least one alertable thread. Examples: Chrome.exe, Iexplore.exe, Skype.exe, VLC.exe, MsPaint.exe, WmiPrvSE.exe, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So now we have to find an alertable thread in the target process. There are many ways of doing this. I chose to use a method that is trivial, works in most cases, and is easy to implement and explain.<br/>
<br/>
We’ll create an event for each thread in the target process, then ask each thread to set its corresponding event. We’ll wait on the event handles, until one is triggered. The thread whose corresponding event was triggered is an alertable thread.<br/>
<br/>
How can an event be set? By calling SetEvent(HANDLE hEvent).<br/>
<br/>
How will we get the threads in the target process to call SetEvent? APC of course. Since SetEvent receives exactly one parameter we can use QueueUserApc to call it.
