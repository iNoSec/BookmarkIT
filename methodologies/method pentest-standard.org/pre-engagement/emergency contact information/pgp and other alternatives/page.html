<title>PGP and Other Alternatives</title>
</head><body>Encryption is not optional. Communication with the customer is an absolutely necessary part of any penetration testing engagement and due to the sensitive nature of the engagement, communications of sensitive information must be encrypted, especially the final report. Before the testing begins, a means of secure communication must be established with the client. Several common means of encryption are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
PGP/GPG can be used to both communicate over e-mail and to encrypt the final report (remember that subject lines are passed through in plaintext)<br/>
A secure mailbox hosted on the customerâ€™s network<br/>
Telephone<br/>
Face to face meetings<br/>
To deliver the final report, you can also store the report in an AES encrypted archive file, but make sure that your archive utility supports AES encryption using CBC.<br/>
<br/>
Also ask what kinds of information can be put in writing and which should be communicated only verbally. Some organizations have very good reasons for limiting what security information is transmitted to them in writing.</body></html>
