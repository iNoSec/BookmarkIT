<title>SNMP Sweeps</title>
</head><body>==== SNMP Sweeps ====<br/>
SNMP sweeps are performed too as they offer tons of information about a specific system. The SNMP protocol is a stateless, datagram oriented protocol. Unfortunately SNMP servers don't respond to requests with invalid community strings and the underlying UDP protocol does not reliably report closed UDP ports. This means that &quot;no response&quot; from a probed IP address can mean either of the following:<br/>
<br/>
* machine unreachable<br/>
* SNMP server not running<br/>
* invalid community string<br/>
* the response datagram has not yet arrived</body></html>
