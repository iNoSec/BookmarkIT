<title>Evil Twin</title>
</head><body>If we can't crack the password on the AP, another strategy that can be successful is creating an Evil Twinâ€”an AP with exactly the same SSID as the known AP, but controlled by us. The key is for the target to connect to our AP, rather than the authentic AP.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, computers will automatically connect to the AP with the strongest signal, so turning up the power on your AP can be a critical element of this hack. When the user connects to our AP, we can then capture all their traffic and view it, as well as capture any other credentials they present to other systems.<br/>
<br/>
An effective variation on the Evil Twin is to set up a system with the same SSID and then present the user with a logon screen. Many corporate offices, hotels, coffee shops, etc. employ this type of security. When the user presents their credentials in our fake logon screen, we capture the credentials and store them. We can then use those credentials on their authentic AP to gain their access.<br/>
<br/>
This process has been automated by a script called Airsnarf. Unfortunately, Airsnarf is out of date, but I have been working on updating it and will present the script and tutorial soon.</body></html>
