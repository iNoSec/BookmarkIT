<title>Restoration</title>
</head><body>We do have one problem, though. The thread that we hijacked had a purpose before we had hijacked it. If we don’t restore its execution, there is no telling what kind of effect we could have on the target process.<br/>
<br/>
How do we restore execution? I’d like to remind you that we are now in the context of an APC. When the APC function completes, somehow execution is restored safely. Let’s look at the dispatching of APCs from the target process’s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the function in charge of dispatching APCs (WaitForSingleObjectEx in this example) is ntdll!KiUserApcDispatcher.<br/>
<br/>
We can see 3 “calls” in this block of code. The first call is to CFG, the next call is to ECX (which is the address of the APC function), and finally a call to the undocumented ZwContinue.<br/>
<br/>
ZwContinue expects to receive a pointer to a CONTEXT structure and resumes the execution. Actually the kernel will check if there are any more APCs in the thread’s APC queue, and dispatch them before finally resuming the thread’s original execution, but we can ignore that.<br/>
<br/>
The CONTEXT structure being passed to ZwContinue is stored in EDI before calling the APC function (stored in ECX). We can save EDI’s value at the beginning of our shellcode, and call ZwContinue with EDI’s original value at the end of the shellcode, thereby restoring execution safely.<br/>
<br/>
See <a href="https://github.com/BreakingMalwareResearch/atom-bombing/blob/f5a04e3fd6eda114e1a7e66429d7e9ec864ec7d4/AtomBombingShellcode/main.c#L31"><i>AtomBombingShellcode</i></a><i> </i>in <a href="https://github.com/BreakingMalwareResearch/atom-bombing">AtomBombing’s GitHub repository</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We have to make sure that the value of EDI will not be overridden during the call to NtSetContextThread, since it modifies the values of the registers. This can easily be accomplished by setting ContextFlags (member of the CONTEXT structure passed to NtSetContextThread) to CONTEXT_CONTROL which means that only EBP, EIP, SEGCS, EFLAGS, ESP, and SEGSS will be affected. As long as (CONTEXT.ContextFlags|CONTEXT_INTEGER == 0) we should be ok.<br/>
<br/>
And there you have it, we have injected code into chrome.exe. Our injected code spawned the classic calc.exe proving that it works.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s try to inject code into vlc.exe:<br/>
<br/>
The complete implementation can be found on <a href="https://github.com/BreakingMalwareResearch/atom-bombing">GitHub</a>. It has been tested against Windows 10 x64 Build 1511 (WOW) and Windows 10 x86 Build 10240. Compile for “release”.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s do the same with mspaint.exe:<br/>
