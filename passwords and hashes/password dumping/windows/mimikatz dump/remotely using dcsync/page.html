<title>Remotely Using DCSync</title>
</head><body><br/>
A major feature added to Mimkatz in August 2015 is “DCSync” which effectively “impersonates” a Domain Controller and requests account password data from the targeted Domain Controller. DCSync was written by Benjamin Delpy and Vincent Le Toux. As of Mimikatz version 2.1 alpha 20160501, DCSync works with renamed domains.<br/>
<br/>
The exploit method prior to DCSync was to run Mimikatz or Invoke-Mimikatz on a Domain Controller to get the KRBTGT password hash to create Golden Tickets. With Mimikatz’s DCSync and the appropriate rights, the attacker can pull the password hash, as well as previous password hashes, from a Domain Controller over the network without requiring interactive logon or copying off the Active Directory database file (ntds.dit).<br/>
<br/>
Special rights are required to run DCSync. Any member of Administrators, Domain Admins, or Enterprise Admins as well as Domain Controller computer accounts are able to run DCSync to pull password data. Note that Read-Only Domain Controllers are not only allowed to pull password data for users by default.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How DCSync works:</b><br/>
<ul><li>Discovers Domain Controller in the specified domain name.</li>
<li>Requests the Domain Controller replicate the user credentials via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd207691.aspx">GetNCChanges </a>(leveraging <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc228086.aspx">Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol</a>)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
I have previously done some packet captures for <a href="http://blogs.metcorpconsulting.com/tech/?p=923">Domain Controller replication</a>and identified the intra-DC communication flow regarding how Domain Controllers replicate.<br/>
<br/>
The Samba Wiki describes the <a href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/DRSUAPI">DSGetNCChanges function</a>:<br/>
<br/>
<i>“The client DC sends a DSGetNCChanges request to the server when the first one wants to get AD objects updates from the second one. The response contains a set of updates that the client has to apply to its NC replica. …<br/>
</i><i>When a DC receives a DSReplicaSync Request, then for each DC that it replicates from (stored in RepsFrom data structure) it performs a replication cycle where it behaves like a client and makes DSGetNCChanges requests to that DC. So it gets up-to-date AD objects from each of the DC’s which it replicates from.”</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>DCSync Options:</b><br/>
<ul><li>/all – DCSync pull data for the entire domain.</li>
<li>/user – user id or SID of the user you want to pull the data for.</li>
<li>/domain (optional) – FQDN of the Active Directory domain. Mimikatz will discover a DC in the domain to connect to. If this parameter is not provided, Mimikatz defaults to the current domain.</li>
<li>/csv – export to csv</li>
<li>/dc (optional) – Specify the Domain Controller you want DCSync to connect to and gather data.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There’s also a /guid parameter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>DCSync Command Examples:</b><br/>
<br/>
Pull password data for the KRBTGT user account in the rd.adsecurity.org domain:<br/>
<i>Mimikatz “lsadump::dcsync /domain:rd.adsecurity.org /user:krbtgt” exit</i><br/>
<br/>
Pull password data for the Administrator user account in the rd.adsecurity.org domain:<br/>
<i>Mimikatz “lsadump::dcsync /domain:rd.adsecurity.org /user:Administrator” exit</i><br/>
<br/>
Pull password data for the ADSDC03 Domain Controller computer account in the lab.adsecurity.org domain:<br/>
<i>Mimikatz  “lsadump::dcsync /domain:lab.adsecurity.org /user:adsdc03$” exit</i><br/>
<br/>
If the <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=2053">account is enabled for “reversible encryption”</a>, the clear-text password shown.</body></html>
