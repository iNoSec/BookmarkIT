<title>Technical Report</title>
</head><body>== Technical Report ==<br/>
<br/>
This section will communicate to the reader the technical details of the test and all of the aspects/components agreed upon as key success indicators within the pre engagement exercise. The technical report section will describe in detail the scope, information, attack path, impact and remediation suggestions of the test.<br/>
<br/>
'''Introduction:'''<br/>
<br/>
The introduction section of the technical report is intended to be an initial inventory of:<br/>
*Personnel involved in the testing from both the Client and Penetration Testing Team<br/>
*Contact information<br/>
*Assets involved in testing<br/>
*Objectives of Test <br/>
*Scope of Test <br/>
*Strength of Test <br/>
*Approach <br/>
*Threat/Grading Structure <br/>
<br/>
This section should be a reference for the specific resources involved in the testing and the overall technical scope of the test.<br/>
<br/>
'''Information Gathering:'''<br/>
<br/>
Intelligence gathering and information assessment are the foundations of a good penetration test. The more informed the tester is about the environment, the better the results of the test will be. In this section, a number of items should be written up to show the CLIENT the extent of public and private information available through the execution of the Intelligence gathering phase of PTES. At a minimum, the results identified should be presented in 4 basic categories:<br/>
<br/>
'''Passive Intelligence:'''<br/>
<br/>
Intelligence gathered from indirect analysis such as DNS,Google dorking for IP/infrastructure related information. This section will focus on the techniques used to profile the technology in the CLIENT environment WITHOUT sending any traffic directly to the assets.<br/>
<br/>
'''Active Intelligence:'''<br/>
<br/>
This section will show the methods and results of tasks such as infrastructure mapping, port scanning, and architecture assessment and other foot printing activities. This section will focus on the techniques used to profile the technology in the CLIENT environment by sending traffic DIRECTLY to the assets.<br/>
<br/>
'''Corporate Intelligence:'''<br/>
<br/>
Information about the structure of the organization, business units, market share, vertical, and other corporate functions should be mapped to both business process and the previously identified physical assets being tested.<br/>
<br/>
'''Personnel Intelligence:''' <br/>
<br/>
Any and all information found during the intelligence collection phase which maps users to the CLIENT organization. This section should show the techniques used to harvest intelligence such as public/private employee depots, mail repositories, org charts and other items leading to the connection of employee/company.<br/>
<br/>
'''Vulnerability Assessment:'''<br/>
<br/>
Vulnerability assessment is the act of identifying the POTENTIAL vulnerabilities which exist in a TEST and the threat classification of each threat. In this section, a definition of the methods used to identify the vulnerability as well as the evidence/classification of the vulnerability should be present. In addition this section should include:<br/>
<br/>
*Vulnerability Classification Levels <br/>
*Technical Vulnerabilities <br/>
**OSI Layer Vulns <br/>
**Scanner Found <br/>
**Manually identified <br/>
**Overall Exposure <br/>
*Logical Vulnerabilities <br/>
**NON OSI Vuln <br/>
**Type of vuln <br/>
**How/Where it is found <br/>
**Exposure <br/>
*Summary of Results<br/>
<br/>
'''Exploitation/ Vulnerability Confirmation:'''<br/>
<br/>
Exploitation or Vulnerability confirmation is the act of triggering the vulnerabilities identified in the previous sections to gain a specified level of access to the target asset. This section should review, in detail, all of the steps taken to confirm the defined vulnerability as well as the following:<br/>
<br/>
*Exploitation Timeline <br/>
*Targets selected for Exploitation <br/>
*Exploitation Activities <br/>
**Directed Attack <br/>
***Target Hosts unable to be Exploited <br/>
***Target Hosts able to be Exploited <br/>
****Individual Host Information <br/>
****Attacks conducted <br/>
****Attacks Successful <br/>
****Level of access Granted +escalation path <br/>
****Remediation <br/>
*****Link to Vuln section reference <br/>
*****Additional Mitigating technique <br/>
*****Compensating control suggestion <br/>
*Indirect Attack <br/>
**Phishing <br/>
***Timeline/details of attack <br/>
***Targets identified <br/>
***Success/Fail ratio <br/>
***Level of access granted<br/>
**Clientside <br/>
***Timeline/details of attack <br/>
***Targets identified <br/>
***Success/Fail ratio <br/>
***Level of access granted <br/>
**Browser Side <br/>
***Timeline/details of attack <br/>
***Targets identified <br/>
***Success/Fail ratio <br/>
***Level of access granted<br/>
<br/>
'''Post Exploitation:'''<br/>
<br/>
One of the most critical items in all testing is the connection to ACTUAL impact on the CLIENT being tested. While the sections above relay the technical nature of the vulnerability and the ability to successfully take advantage of the flaw, the Post Exploitation section should tie the ability of exploitation to the actual risk to the business. In this area the following items should be evidenced through the use of screenshots, rich content retrieval, and examples of real world privileged user access:<br/>
<br/>
*Privilege Escalation path <br/>
**Technique used <br/>
*Acquisition of Critical Information Defined by client <br/>
*Value of information<br/>
*Access to core business systems<br/>
*Access to compliance protected data sets<br/>
*Additional Information/Systems Accessed <br/>
*Ability of persistence<br/>
*Ability for exfiltration<br/>
*Countermeasure Effectiveness <br/>
*: This section should cover the effectiveness of countermeasures that are in place on the systems in scope. It should include sections on both active (proactive) and passive (reactive) countermeasures, as well as detailed information on any incident response activities triggered during the testing phase. A listing of countermeasures that were effective in resisting assessment activities will help the CLIENT better tune detection systems and processes to handle future intrusion attempts.<br/>
**Detection Capability <br/>
***FW/WAF/IDS/IPS <br/>
***Human <br/>
***DLP <br/>
***Log <br/>
**Response &amp; effectiveness<br/>
<br/>
'''Risk/Exposure:'''<br/>
<br/>
Once the direct impact to the business is qualified through the evidence existing in the vulnerability, exploitation and post exploitation sections, the risk quantification can be conducted. In this section the results above are combined with the risk values, information criticality, corporate valuation, and derived business impact from the pre engagement section. This will give the CLIENT the ability to identify, visualize and monetize the vulnerabilities found throughout the testing and effectively weight their resolution against the CLIENTS business objectives. This section will cover the business risk in the following subsections:<br/>
<br/>
*Evaluate incident frequency <br/>
**probable event frequency <br/>
**estimate threat capability (from 3 - threat modeling) <br/>
**Estimate controls strength (6) <br/>
**Compound vulnerability (5) <br/>
**Level of skill required <br/>
**Level of access required <br/>
*Estimate loss magnitude per incident <br/>
**Primary loss <br/>
**Secondary loss <br/>
**Identify risk root cause analysis <br/>
***Root Cause is never a patch <br/>
***Identify Failed Processes <br/>
*Derive Risk <br/>
**Threat <br/>
**Vulnerability <br/>
**Overlap<br/>
<br/>
'''Conclusion:'''<br/>
<br/>
Final overview of the test. It is suggested that this section echo portions of the overall test as well as support the growth of the CLIENT security posture. It should end on a positive note with the support and guidance to enable progress in the security program and a regimen of testing/security activity in the future to come.<br/>
