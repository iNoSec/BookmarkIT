</head><body>== Evasion ==<br/>
<br/>
Evasion is the technique used in order to escape detection during a penetration test. This could be circumventing a camera system as to not be seen by a guard, obfuscating your payloads to evade Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) or encoding requests/responses to circumvent web application firewalls. Overall, the need to identify a low risk scenario for evading a technology or person should be formulated prior to the exploit.</body></html>
