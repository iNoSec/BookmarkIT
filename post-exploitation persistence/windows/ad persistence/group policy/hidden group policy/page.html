</head><body><b>“Hidden Group Policy” – Group Policies Applied to Sites<br/>
</b><br/>
We know that Group Policy is typically applied to Organizational Units and we can easily view them in GPMC.<br/>
<br/>
However, many admins don’t realize that while it is not best practice to link Group Policies to sites, there’s nothing preventing a Domain Admin (Enterprise Admin) from doing so.<br/>
<br/>
All that’s needed is to select the AD sites that should be shown in the Group Policy Management Console and link the new/updated Group Policies to the site(s)<br/>
<br/>
Looking at GPMC, we can see there are two Group Policies linked to the HQ Site and both of them were last modified recently (hint, hint).<br/>
