<title>Starting Point</title>
</head><body>Executing Starting Point<br/>
There are a couple of options (see methods above) when instructing the target process to launch our DLL. Unfortunately we can't just provide the name of our DLL to these functions, we have to provide a memory address. We can perform the Allocate and Copy steps to obtain space within the target process' memory and prepare it as an execution starting point. <br/>
<br/>
There are two popular starting points: <ul><li>LoadLibraryA()</li>
<li>Jumping to DllMain</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>LoadLibraryA()</b><br/>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684175%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">LoadLibraryA()</a>is a kernel32.dll function that is used to load DLLs, executables, and other supporting libraries at run time. It takes a filename as its only parameter and magically makes everything work. This means we just need to allocate some memory for th epath to our DLL and set our execution starting point to the address of LoadLibraryA(), providing the memory address where the path lies as the parameter. <br/>
<br/>
The major downside to LoadLibraryA() is that it registers the loaded DLL with the program and thus can be easily detected. Another slightly annoying caveat is that if a DLL has already been loaded once with LoadLibraryA(), it will not execute it. You can work around this issue, but it's more code. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Jumping to DllMain (or another entry point)</b><br/>
An alternative to LoadLibraryA() is to load the entire DLL into memory and then determine the offset to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682583%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">DLL's entry point</a>. You can avoid registering the DLL with the program and repeatedly inject into a process.<br/>
