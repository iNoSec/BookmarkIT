<title>Buffer Overflows</title>
</head><body>==== Buffer Overflows ====<br/>
<br/>
Buffer overflows occur due to improper coding techniques. Specifically this usually occurs when a program writes data to a buffer and then overruns the buffer's boundary and begins to overwrite portions of memory. In buffer overflow exploits the attackers goal is to control a crash and gain code execution on the given system. In a buffer overflow exploit, one of the more common techniques is to overwrite a given register and &quot;jump&quot; to the shellcode. </body></html>
