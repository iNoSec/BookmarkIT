</head><body>=== Data Execution Prevention (DEP) ===<br/>
<br/>
When performing exploitation, many preventative measures canc ome into play. Data Execution Prevention is a defensive measure implemented into most operating systems and prevents execute permission when an overwrite in memory has occurred. The thought process behind DEP is to stop an attacker in rewriting memory and then executing that code. There are mulitple methods to bypass data execution prevention and discussed later in the the exploitation phase of PTES.</body></html>
