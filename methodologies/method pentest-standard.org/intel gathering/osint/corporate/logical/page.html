<br/>
Touchgraph (L1)<br/>
A touchgraph (visual representation of the social connections between people) will assist in mapping out the possible interactions between people in the organization, and how to access them from the outside (when a touchgraph includes external communities and is created with a depth level of above 2).<br/>
<br/>
The basic touchgraph should reflect the organizational structure derived from the information gathered so far, and further expansion of the graph should be based on it (as it usually represents the focus on the organizational assets better, and make possible approach vectors clear.<br/>
<br/>
Hoovers profile (L1/L2)<br/>
What: a semi-open source intelligence resource (paid subscriptions usually). Such sources specialize in gathering business related information on companies, and providing a “normalized” view on the business.<br/>
<br/>
Why: The information includes physical locations, competitive landscape, key personnel, financial information, and other business related data (depending on the source). This can be used to create a more accurate profile of the target, and identify additional personnel and 3rd parties which can be used in the test.<br/>
<br/>
How: Simple search on the site with the business name provide the entire profile of the company and all the information that is available on it. Its recommended to use a couple of sources in order to cross reference them and make sure you get the most up-to-date information. (paid for service).<br/>

Job openings (L1/L2)<br/>
By viewing a list of job openings at an organization (usually found in a ‘careers’ section of their website), you can determine types of technologies used within the organization. One example would be if an organization has a job opening for a Senior Solaris Sysadmin then it is pretty obvious that the organization is using Solaris systems. Other positions may not be as obvious by the job title, but an open Junior Network Administrator position may say something to the effect of ‘CCNA preferred’ or ‘JNCIA preferred’ which tells you that they are either using Cisco or Juniper technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Charity affiliations (L1/L2/L3)<br/>
It is very common for executive members of a target organization to be associated with charitable organizations. This information can be used to develop solid social engineering scenarios for targeting executives.<br/>
<br/>
RFP, RFQ and other Public Bid Information (L1/L2)<br/>
RFPs and RFQs often reveal a lot of information about the types of systems used by a company, and potentially even gaps or issues with their infrastructure.<br/>
<br/>
Finding out who current bid winners are may reveal the types of systems being used or a location where company resources might be hosted off-site.<br/>
<br/>
Court records (L2/L3)<br/>
Court records are usually available either free or sometimes at a fee.<br/>
Contents of litigation can reveal information about past complainants including but not limited to former employee lawsuits<br/>
Criminal records of current and past employees may provide a list of targets for social engineering efforts<br/>
<br/>
Political donations (L2/L3)<br/>
Mapping out political donations or other financial interests is important in order to identify pivotal individuals who may not be in obvious power positions but have a vested interest (or there is a vested interes in them).<br/>
Political donation mapping will change between countries based on the freedom of information, but often cases donations from other countries can be traced back using the data available there.<br/>
<br/>
Professional licenses or registries (L2/L3)<br/>
Gathering a list of your targets professional licenses and registries may offer an insight into not only how the company operated, but also the guidelines and regulations that they follow in order to maintain those licenses. A prime example of this is a companies ISO standard certification can show that a company follows set guidelines and processes. It is important for a tester to be aware of these processes and how they could affect tests being performed on the organization.<br/>
<br/>
A company will often list these details on their website as a badge of honor. In other cases it may be necessary to search registries for the given vertical in order to see if an organization is a member. The information that is available is very dependent on the vertical market, as well as the geographical location of the company. It should also be noted that international companies may be licensed differently and be required to register with different standards or legal bodies dependent on the country.</body></html>
