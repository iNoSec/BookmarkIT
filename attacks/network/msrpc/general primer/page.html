</head><body>RPC server programs typically use dynamic port mappings to avoid conflicts with programs and protocols registered in the range of well-known TCP ports. RPC server programs associate their universally unique identifier (UUID) with a dynamic port and register the combination with the RPC EPM. The EPM provides a single point of contact for RPC clients. The RPC clients contact the EPM and use the server programâ€™s UUID to determine the port being used by the server program. The following table indicates the network ports normally used by RPC.<br/>
Port Assignments for RPC<br/>
<br/>
Service Name 		UDP 			TCP<br/>
HTTP				80, 443, 593		80, 443, 593<br/>
Named Pipes			445				445<br/>
RPC Endpoint Mapper 	135				135<br/>
<br/>
RPC Server Programs	&lt;Dynamically assigned&gt;	&lt;Dynamically assigned&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The MSRPC port mapper is advertised on TCP and UDP 135 by Windows systems. It cannot be disabled without drastically affecting the core functionality of the operating system<br/>
<br/>
MSRPC interfaces are also available via other ports, including TCP/UDP 139, 445 or 593, and can also be configured to listen over a custom HTTP port via IIS or COM Internet Services<br/>
