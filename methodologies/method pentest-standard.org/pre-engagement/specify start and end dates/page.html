</head><body>Specify Start and End Dates<br/>
Another key component defeating scope creep is explicitly stating start and end dates. This allows the project to have definite end. One of the most common areas in which scope creep occurs is during retesting. Retesting always sounds like a good idea when going after a contract. It shows that the firm is caring and diligent, trying to make ensure that the customer is secure as possible. The problem begins when it is forgotten that the work is not paid for until it is completed. This includes retesting.<br/>
<br/>
To mitigate this risk, add a simple statement to the contract which mentions that all retesting must be done within a certain timeframe after the final report delivery. It then becomes the responsibility of the testers to spearhead the retesting effort. If the customer requests an extension, always allow this with the condition that payment be fulfilled at the originally specified date. Finally, and most importantly, perform a quality retest. Remember, the best source for future work is your existing customer base.</body></html>
