<title>Example</title>
</head><body>In this scenario, the attacker creates the user account “bobafett” and adds the default administrator account for the domain, “ADSAdministrator” (RID 500), to the account’s SID History attribute.<br/>
<br/>
When the bobafett account logs on, all of the SIDs associated with the account are added to the user’s token which is used to determine access to resources. The SIDs associated with the account is the user’s SID, the group SIDs in which the user is a member (including groups that those groups are a member of), and SIDs contained in SID History.<br/>
<br/>
Using the PowerShell Active Directory cmdlet “Get-ADUser”, we can see there is no group membership assigned to the bobafett account, though it does have a SID in SIDHistory (the ADSAdministrator account).<br/>
<br/>
When bobafett logs on, the SIDs associated with the account are evaluated and access determined based on these SIDs. Since the bobafett account is associated with the ADSAdmnistrator account (RID 500), the bobafett account has all access the ADSAdministrator account has, including Domain Admin rights.<br/>
<br/>
Leveraging the bobafett user account and the rights granted to it through SID History, it is possible to use PowerShell remoting to pull the KRBTGT account password data from a Domain Controller.</body></html>
