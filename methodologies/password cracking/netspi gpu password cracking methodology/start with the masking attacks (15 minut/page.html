<title>Start with the masking attacks (15 minutes*)</title>
</head><body>Using mask attacks allows us to match common password patterns. Based on the passwords that we’ve cracked in the past, we identified the fifty most common password patterns (that our clients use). Here’s a handy perl script for identifying those patterns – http://pastebin.com/Sybzwf3K.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the excessive time that some of these masks take, we’ve trimmed our list down to forty-three masks. The masks are based on the types of characters being used for the password They follow the following format:<br/>
<br/>
?u?l?l?l?l?d?d?d<br/>
<br/>
This is equivalent to (1 Uppercase Character) (4 Lowercase Characters) (3 Decimals). Or a more practical example would be “Netsp199”<br/>
<br/>

Our top forty-three masks take about fifteen minutes to run through and caught (29/326) 8% of the remaining uncracked hashes from this sample.</body></html>
