<br/>
A SMB Server that answers specific file contents regardless of the SMB share and pathname specified.<br/>
<br/>
# Karma SMB<br/>
#<br/>
# Description:<br/>
#  The idea of this script is to answer any file read request<br/>
#  with a set of predefined contents based on the extension <br/>
#  asked, regardless of the sharename and/or path.<br/>
#  When executing this script w/o a config file the pathname <br/>
#  file contents will be sent for every request. <br/>
#  If a config file is specified, format should be this way:<br/>
#   &lt;extension&gt; = &lt;pathname&gt;<br/>
#  for example:<br/>
#   bat = /tmp/batchfile<br/>
#   com = /tmp/comfile<br/>
#   exe = /tmp/exefile<br/>
#<br/>
#  The SMB2 support works with a caveat. If two different<br/>
#  filenames at the same share are requested, the first<br/>
#  one will work and the second one will not work if the request<br/>
#  is performed right away. This seems related to the <br/>
#  QUERY_DIRECTORY request, where we return the files available.<br/>
#  In the first try, we return the file that was asked to open.<br/>
#  In the second try, the client will NOT ask for another <br/>
#  QUERY_DIRECTORY but will use the cached one. This time the new file<br/>
#  is not there, so the client assumes it doesn't exist.<br/>
#  After a few seconds, looks like the client cache is cleared and<br/>
#  the operation works again. Further research is needed trying<br/>
#  to avoid this from happening.<br/>
#<br/>
#  SMB1 seems to be working fine on that scenario.<br/>
#<br/>
#  ToDo:<br/>
#  [ ] A lot of testing needed under different OSes. <br/>
#    I'm still not sure how reliable this approach is.<br/>
#  [ ] Add support for other SMB read commands. Right now just<br/>
#    covering SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX<br/>
#  [ ] Disable write request, now if the client tries to copy <br/>
#    a file back to us, it will overwrite the files we're <br/>
#    hosting. *CAREFUL!!!*<br/>
<br/>
usage: karmaSMB.py [--help] [-config pathname] [-smb2support] pathname<br/>
<br/>
For every file request received, this module will return the pathname contents<br/>
<br/>
positional arguments:<br/>
 pathname     Pathname's contents to deliver to SMB clients<br/>
<br/>
optional arguments:<br/>
 --help      show this help message and exit<br/>
 -config pathname config file name to map extensions to files to deliver.<br/>
          For those extensions not present, pathname will be<br/>
          delivered<br/>
 -smb2support   SMB2 Support (experimental!)<br/>
