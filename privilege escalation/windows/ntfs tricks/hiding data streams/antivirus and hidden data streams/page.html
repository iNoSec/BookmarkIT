<title>Antivirus And Hidden Data Streams</title>
</head><body>I did a quick verification of the above mentioned tricks against AntiVirus products to verify if these can catch malware which abuses the tricks. The most noteworthy finding was with files / folders ending with “. .”. For example, I stored the eicar test virus in a folder and copied it with the following commands:<br/>
<br/>
copy eicar.com &gt; &quot;123. .::$DATA&quot;<br/>
copy eicar.com &gt; tester <br/>
echo 123 &gt; &quot;foo. .::INDEX_ALLOCATION&quot; <br/>
cd &quot;foo. .::$INDEX_ALLOCATION&quot; <br/>
copy ..\eicar.com . <br/>
copy ..\eicar.com .\eicar<br/>
<br/>
After that I re-enabled the AntiVirus solutions and scanned the folder. All AntiVirus solutions just identified “eicar.com” and “tester” in this folder, but not the eicar virus in “123. .” or in the two files in the “foo. .” folder. However, when this folder is entered and the files are started, the AntiVirus products found them (because the content is loaded from the file system to memory). The “remove” action from Windows Defender could not remove the files and has therefore no impact, however, the “remove” action from for example Emsisoft could remove the test virus in the folder. Emsisoft just removed the “eicar.com” file in the “foo. .” folder, the “eicar” file was not removed and the content can be read without a problem (Emsisoft responded to us that only files which are mapped as executable are scanned with the exception of some specific file extensions like .com. This behavior can be altered in the file guard settings by switching to “Thorough” to also scan at file reads; Windows Defender on the other hand also blocked reading the “eicar” text file).<br/>
<br/>
I also conducted a short test against Autopsy 4.6.0 (a free forensic software) by loading “logical files” into the tool (from the running system; not a disk image). The “…” folder can be entered, however, the “foo. .” folder can’t. Moreover, I created a file named “valid” with the content “valid” and a file called “valid. .” with the content “secret”. Autopsy shows for both files the content “valid” (and never the “secret” content). In addition to that, the “.. ” folder (with a space at the end) is intepreted as “..” and therefore goes one directory up at double click. This only applies to the “logical files” mode, in disk image (raw) mode, everything is displayed correctly (in the live mode Autopsy is using the Windows API to access the data and therefore problems occur).</body></html>
