<title>Run VS Exec</title>
</head><body>We use Run when we are calling an external command-line program (or any command that the prompt recognizes). <br/>
It can return %ERRORLEVEL% and with this code, we can show a message to the user saying if the operation was success or not. <br/>
It doesn't support async output, it means that you can't show to the user the output of the external program in real-time, <br/>
you need to wait till the program exits.</body></html>
