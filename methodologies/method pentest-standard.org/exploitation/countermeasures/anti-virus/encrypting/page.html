<title>Encrypting</title>
</head><body>==== Encrypting ====<br/>
<br/>
Encrypting, like Encoding and Packing is another method of manipulating the intended runnable code such that it is not recognizable or available for inspection. Only after decrypting in in-memory (with methods similar to packing) the actual code is exposed for the first time - hopefully after security mechanisms have allowed it through and it is executed immediately after it is decrypted.</body></html>
