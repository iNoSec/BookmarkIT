<title>Environment Variables In Scheduled Tasks</title>
</head><body>The Windows Task Scheduler is a great place to go and find privilege escalations, it's typically abused to add SUID style capabilities to Windows in a nice easy to misunderstand package. It can execute programs as LocalSystem, it can auto-elevate applications for UAC, it can even host arbitrary COM objects. All in all it's a mess, which is why finding bugs in the scheduler itself or in the tasks isn't especially difficult. </body></html>
