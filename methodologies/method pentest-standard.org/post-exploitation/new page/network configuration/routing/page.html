Knowledge of other subnets, filtering or addressing schemes could be leveraged to escape a segmented network, leading to additional hosts and/or networks to probe and enumerate. This data could come from a variety of sources on a particluar host or network including:<br/>
*Interfaces<br/>
*Routing tables, including static and dynamic routes<br/>
*ARP Tables, NetBios or other network protocols used for service and host discovery.<br/>
