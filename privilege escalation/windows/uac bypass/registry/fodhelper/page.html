<title>FodHelper</title>
</head><body>Fodhelper.exe was introduced in Win10 to managed optional features. Located in C:\Windows\System32\fodhelper.exe and is signed by Microsoft<br/>
<br/>
When initiating the start of fodhelper.exe, process monitor starts to capture the process and reveals (among other things) every read- or write-activity to the registry and filesystem. One of the interesting activities are the read accesses to registry, although some specific keys or values are not found. Especially registry keys in HKEY_CURRENT_USER are great to test how the behavior of a program may change after the creation of a not yet existing registry key, because we do not need special privileges to modify entries.<br/>
<br/>
E.g. fodhelper.exe is looking for <b>“HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command”.</b>By default this key does not exist in Windows 10.<br/>
<br/>
After creation of the key: “HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command”, fodhelper.exe will find it and will start looking for the value: “<b>HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\DelegateExecute</b>” which it would not look for, if the mentioned key did not exist. As soon as the value “DelegateExecute” exists, it will be found, too, even if it is empty.<br/>
<br/>
Once the value “DelegateExecute” is created, fodhelper.exe will look for the default value in: “<b>HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command\</b>”.<br/>
<br/>
This value is the critical point. The registry value “shell\open\command\(default)” enables us to provide to the program additional instructions what to do when the program opens.<br/>
<br/>
In this scenario, I set the value of “shell\open\command\(default)” to: “C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c powershell.exe”. After this modification, fodhelper.exe will lookup the (default)-value and follow the instructions how to behave after the process starts. =&gt; start cmd.exe which starts powershell.exe (just checking if it is possible to pass parameters to cmd.exe, too)<br/>
<br/>
To demonstrate this vulnerability, I created and published a script on Github, which will create the registry keys, opens up “C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c powershell.exe” and which deletes the registry keys.<br/>
<br/>
This technique is based on a similiar flaw, found by Matt Nelson (https://enigma0x3.net/) and has the following benefits:<br/>
<br/>
  There is no need to drop a file on disk.<br/>
  There is no need to hijack any .dll file<br/>
  There is no need for any suspicious action on the operating system which could alert an antivirus software.<br/>
<br/>
Ways of mitigation:<br/>
<br/>
  Do not use a local administrator account if you do not have to. Restricted users are not able to execute and elevate such programs.<br/>
  Set the UAC level to “Always notify”, which leads to a prompt that needs to be accepted by the user.<br/>
