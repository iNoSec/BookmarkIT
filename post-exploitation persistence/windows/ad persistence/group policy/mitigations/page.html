After testing, change the Group Policy default setting to re-apply GPO settings at every refresh (Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed). This does have a potential performance hit on the client, but will ensure all GPO enforced settings are re-applied.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Computer Configuration, Policies, Administrative Templates, System, Group Policy, Configure security policy processing</i>: Set to Enabled.<br/>
Also check the box for “<i>Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed</i>”<br/>
<br/>
It’s also recommended to configure the same settings for each of the following:<br/>
<ul><li><i>Computer Configuration, Policies, Administrative Templates, System, Group Policy, Configure registry policy processing</i></li>
<li><i>Computer Configuration, Policies, Administrative Templates, System, Group Policy, Configure scripts policy processing</i></li>
<li>As well as any other policy settings as needed.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Mitigation</b><br/>
All Group Policies in the AD environment should be configured for a single purpose and monitored for unauthorized modification, especially GPOs linked to the domain, Domain Controllers OU, and/or a top level OU such as workstations, servers, admins, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Delegated permissions to Group Policy should be reviewed on a regular basis, especially those linked to top-level OUs. Only Active Directory administrators should have modify rights to GPOs applied to the domain, top-level OUs, and any GPOs linked to critical assets (Domain Controllers, servers, admin computers, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, all sites should be reviewed for linked Group Policies since these GPOs can cross domain boundaries enabling privilege escalation across domains in the same AD forest.<br/>
<br/>
SYSVOL permissions are critical and must remain the same as the default settings since SYSYOL contains the actual Group Policy settings in files that are applied by GPO clients. If a GPO configuration file has permissions that enables some on who is not an Active Directory admin to change the file, and thus change what action the GPO client actually performs, an attacker could quickly escalate permissions up to Domain Admin level.<br/>
