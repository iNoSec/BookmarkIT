</head><body>Mitigation Techniques <br/>
Since there is no inherent solution, full mitigation must be provided externally. Measures include:<br/>
<ul><li>Detecting authentication protocol anomalies. For instance, the use of a non-default encryption algorithm.</li>
<li>Identifying the attack by correlating the abnormal use of encryption methods with the context in which the victim’s identity is used (e.g. unusual services accessed, unusual time of day, day of week, etc.).  </li>
<li>Applying measures to reduce the attack surface. Note that these measures only reduce the attack surface and do not eliminate it altogether or solve the root cause: </li>
<li>Limiting the attacker’s opportunities to steal the NTLM hash in the first place. This is detailed in Microsoft <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318223528/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036">document</a>“Mitigating Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques”. However, it is important to note that this provides only partial mitigation as detailed in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318223528/http://www.aorato.com/blog/windows-update-fix-pass-hash-vulnerability/">blog post</a>“Windows Update to Fix Pass-the-Hash Vulnerability? Not!”.</li>
<li>Ensuring that Windows-based computers in the enterprise are updated with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318223528/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871997">kb2871997 patch</a>, in which several protections had been introduced to make it harder for the attacker to steal the NTLM hashes.</li>
<li>If using Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Functional Level (DFL) domains, add privileged users as members of the newly added Protected Users group. This will disable RC4-HMAC usage in Kerberos for these users. Note that this measure is suitable only for privileged users since the Protected Users group imposes many other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318223528/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn466518.aspx">restrictions</a>on its members.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
We would like to raise the reader’s attention to the fact that Microsoft provided in its response two additional measures: the first is to use a smart card authentication and second, to remove the weaker encryption (i.e. RC4-HMAC) from the systems. However, we do not see either as viable and practical solutions:<br/>
<ul><li>Smart cards are expensive and difficult to deploy throughout an enterprise.</li>
<li>Removing older encryption algorithms require removing its usage throughout the enterprise which may prevent users from accessing older systems.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Windows, there are three ways to block changing passwords when using Kerberos with RC4 secret keys:<br/>
<ul><li>Configure user account as “Smart card is required for interactive logon”. This limits the user to only be able to sign on with a valid smart card, so RC4 AS-REQs are rejected.</li>
<li>Disable Kerberos RC4 support on all domain controllers. This requires, at minimum, Windows Server 2008 Domain Functional Level (DFL) domain and an environment where all Kerberos clients and application servers, as well as trusts to and from the domain, support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Windows began supporting AES with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.</li>
<li>Deploy Windows Server 2012 R2 DFL domains and configure users as members of the new Protected Users well-known security group. This feature disrupts more than just RC4 usage in Kerberos. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318223528/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn466518.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn466518.aspx</a>for details.”</li>
