<title>Deleting Logs</title>
</head><body>export HISTFILE=<br/>
or <br/>
unset HISTFILE<br/>
This next one might not be a good idea, because a lot of folks know to check for tampering with this file, and will be suspicious if they find out:  <br/>
<br/>
However if you happen to be on an account that was originally inaccessible, if the .bash_history file is available (ls -a ~), viewcating its contents can provide you with a good deal of information about the system and its most recent updates/changes. <br/>
clear all history in ram<br/>
history -c<br/>
rm -rf ~/.bash_history &amp;&amp; ln -s ~/.bash_history /dev/null (invasive)<br/>
touch ~/.bash_history (invasive)<br/>
&lt;space&gt; history -c (using a space before a command)  <br/>
zsh% unset HISTFILE HISTSIZE  <br/>
tcsh% set history=0  <br/>
bash$ set +o history<br/>
ksh$ unset HISTFILE<br/>
find / -type f -exec {} (forensics nightmare)<br/>
<br/>
Note that you’re probably better off modifying or temporary disabling rather than deleting history files, it leaves a lot less traces and is less suspect.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases HISTFILE and HISTFILESIZE are made read-only; get around this by explicitly clearing history (history -c) or by kill -9 $$’ing the shell. Sometimes the shell can be configured to run ‘history -w’ after every command; get around this by overriding ‘history’ with a no-op shell function. None of this will help if the shell is configured to log everything to syslog, however.</body></html>
