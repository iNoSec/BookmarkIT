Often service accounts are members of Domain Admins (or equivalent) or a Domain Admin was recently logged on to the computer an attacker dump credentials from. Using these credentials, an attacker can gain access to a Domain Controller and get all domain credentials, including the KRBTGT account NTLM hash which is used to create Kerberos Golden Tickets.<br/>
<br/>
<i>NOTE:<br/>
</i><i>There are many different tools that can dump AD credentials when run locally on the DC, I tend to focus on Mimikatz since it has extensive credential theft and injection capability (and more) enabling credential dumping from a wide variety of sources and scenarios.</i><br/>
<br/>
Command:Â  mimikatz lsadump::lsa /inject exit<br/>
<br/>
Dumps credential data in an Active Directory domain when run on a Domain Controller.<br/>
Requires administrator access with debug or Local SYSTEM rights<br/>
<br/>
Note: The account with RID 502 is the KRBTGT account and the account with RID 500 is the default administrator for the domain.<br/>
