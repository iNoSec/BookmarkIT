<title>Credential Theft Leveraging Unconstrained Delegation</title>
</head><body>As an attacker, once you have found a server with Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation, what’s next?<br/>
<ul><li>Compromise the server via an admin or service account.</li>
<li>Social engineer a Domain Admin to connect to any service on the server with unconstrained delegation.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
When the admin connects to this service, the admin’s TGS service ticket (with the TGT) is delivered to the server and placed into LSASS in case it’s needed later.<br/>
<br/>
The Domain Admin’s authentication (TGT) ticket can be extracted and re-used (until the ticket lifetime expires).<br/>
<br/>
No need to wait though, the ticket can be used immediately in order to get the domain KRBTGT account password hash (when a Domain Admin is compromised).<br/>
In this case we use PowerShell remoting to connect to a Domain Controller as the Domain Admin.<br/>
