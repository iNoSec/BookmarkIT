Verify the ISP terms of service with the customer. In many commercial situations the ISP will have specific provisions for testing. Review these terms carefully before launching an attack. There are situations where ISPs will shun and block certain traffic which is considered malicious. The customer may approve this risk, but it must always be clearly communicated before beginning. Web Hosting As with all other third parties, the scope and timing of the test needs to be clearly communicated with the web hosting provider. Also, when communicating with the client, be sure to clearly articulate the test will only be in search of web vulnerabilities. The test will not uncover vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure which may still provide an avenue to compromise the application.</body></html>
