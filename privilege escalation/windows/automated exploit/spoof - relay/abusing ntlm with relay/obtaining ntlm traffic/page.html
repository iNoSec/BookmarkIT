<title>Obtaining NTLM Traffic</title>
</head><body>Obtaining traffic<br/>
A point which has not been explained yet, is how to get clients to connect with the attacker instead of with the real server. There are several ways to obtain traffic which can be relayed:<br/>
<br/>
Traffic to hosts for which the IP is resolved in an insecure manner<br/>
Traffic resulting from the abuse of AutoDiscovery protocols<br/>
Traffic which is obtained through a man-in-the-middle attack<br/>
<br/>
