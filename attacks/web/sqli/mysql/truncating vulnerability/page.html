<br/>
Basically this happens when you don't validate the length of user input. Two things are needed for it to work:<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">Mysql does not make comparisons in binary mode. This means that &quot;admin&quot; and &quot;admin &quot; are the same.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">If the username column in the database has a character-limit the rest of the characters are truncated, that is removed. So if the database has a column-limit of 20 characters and we input a string with 21 characters the last 1 character will be removed.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"/>
</ul>
With this information we can create a new admin-user and have our own password set to it. So if the max-length is 20 characters we can insert the following string<br/>
admin        removed<br/>
This means that the &quot;removed&quot; part will be removed/truncated/deleted. And the trailing spaces will be removed upon insert in the database. So it will effectively be inserted as &quot;admin&quot;.</body></html>
