<title>Privilege Escalation</title>
</head><body>An attacker could escalate privileges from gaining administrative rights on a computer to having elevated rights in the domain simply because the comptuer's account is joined to an admin group. <br/>
<br/>
For example, if an admin server is joined to a group with backup rights on Domain Controllers, all an attacker needs to do is compromise an admin account with rights to that admin server and then get System rights on that admin server to compromise the domain.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously a few items have to be in place for this to work:<br/>
	Compromise an account with admin rights to admin server<br/>
	Admin server computer account needs rights to Domain Controllers<br/>
Based on my experience, as well as that of others, I have found this to be a scenario that is not only possible, but is reality in a lot of organization. <br/>
<br/>
Note that there are several other ways to take advantage of this and similar scenarios and this isn't the only potential attack.</body></html>
