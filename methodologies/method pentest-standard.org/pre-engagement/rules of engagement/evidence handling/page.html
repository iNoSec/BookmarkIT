</head><body>Evidence Handling<br/>
When handling evidence of a test and the differing stages of the report it is incredibly important to take extreme care with the data. Always use encryption and sanitize your test machine between tests. Never hand out USB sticks with test reports out at security conferences. And whatever you do, don't re-use a report from another customer engagement as a template! It's very unprofessional to leave references to another organization in your document.</body></html>
