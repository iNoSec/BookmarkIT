Another parameter of any given engagement which is important to establish with the customer ahead of time is any destinations to which the testers will need to travel during the test. This could be as simple as identifying local hotels, or complex as identifying the applicable laws of a specific target country.<br/>
<br/>
It is not uncommon for an organization to operate in multiple locations and regions and a few select sites will need to be chosen for testing. In these situations, travel to every customer location should be avoided, instead, it should be determined if VPN connections to the sites are available for remote testing. Disclosure of Sensitive Information<br/>
<br/>
While one of the goals of a given engagement may be to gain access to sensitive information, certain information should not actually be viewed or downloaded. This seems odd to newer testers, however, there are a number of situations where the testers should not have the target data in their possession. For example Personal Health Information (PHI), under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), this data must be protected. In some situations, the target system may not have a firewall or anti-virus (AV) protecting it. In this sort of situation, the testers being in possession of any and all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be absolutely avoided.<br/>
<br/>
However, if the data cannot be physically or virtually obtained, how can it be proved that the testers indeed obtained access to the information? This problem has been solved in a number of ways. There are ways to prove that the vault door was opened without taking any of the money. For instance, a screenshot of database schema and file permissions can be taken, or the files themselves can be displayed without opening them to displaying the content, as long as no PII is visible in the filenames themselves.<br/>
<br/>
How cautious the testers should be on a given engagement is a parameter which needs to be discussed with the client, but the firm doing the testing should always be sure to protect themselves in a legal sense regardless of client opinion. Regardless of supposed exposure to sensitive data, all report templates and tester machines should be sufficiently scrubbed following each engagement. As a special side note, if illegal data (i.e. child pornography) is discovered by the testers, proper law enforcement officials should be notified immediately, followed by the customer. Do not take direction from the customer.</body></html>
