<title>Credential Manager / Protected Storage</title>
</head><body>Credential Manager<br/>
The methods to interact with the Credential Manager is documented by Microsoft and implemented in a number of tools able to dump these credentials.<br/>
<br/>
NirSoftâ€™s Network Password Recovery (netpass) is my first choice. It is one-executable only tool and reliable. Make sure you run the 64-bit version on 64-bit architecture<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Protected Storage<br/>
NirSoft's Protected Storage PassView (pspv) is my first choice. It is one-executable only tool and reliable.<br/>
Another tool to consider is carrot, a bundle of other tools (primarily from NirSoft), good to dump Protected Storage credentials.<br/>
Avoid fgdump as it fails to dump the protected storage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Third-Party<br/>
NirSoft has a vast collection of tools to dump third-party software stored credentials. Many of these are bundled in one-executable only tool, <a href="http://h.ackack.net/carrot-exe.html">carrot</a>.</body></html>
