<title>PsExec</title>
</head><body>At a high-level, the <b>SysInternals PsExec</b>program works as follows:<br/>
<ul><li>Connects to the hidden ADMIN$ share (mapping to the C:\Windows folder) on the remote system via SMB</li>
<li>Utilizes the Service Control Manager (SCM) to start the PsExecsvc service and enable a named pipe on the remote system</li>
<li>Input/output redirection of the console is achieved via the created named pipe</li>
</ul>
<br/>
In order to use PsExec with captured hashes, you need the help of a tool like <a href="http://www.ampliasecurity.com/research/windows-credentials-editor/">Windows Credential Editor (WCE)</a>. This presents it’s own set of issues, as you will be required to drop another executable to disk and risk detection. That being said, the following is a good reference if you are interested in learning more:<a href="http://fuzzynop.blogspot.com/2012/09/pass-hash-without-metasploit.html">Pass The Hash Without Metasploit.</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>Metasploit’s PSExec Module</b><br/>
<br/>
There are several modules within the Metasploit Framework that leverage PsExec-style techniques; however, when you hear someone refer to the PSExec module, they are most likely referring to: exploit/windows/smb/psexec. This is the module that allows for code execution on the target machine, returning a payload (usually a Meterpreter shell) to the attacker.<br/>
<br/>
While similar in functionality to Sysinternal’s PsExec, the Metasploit Framework’s PSExec Module has a few key differences and at a high-level performs the following actions. By default, the module takes the following actions:<br/>
<ul><li>Creates a randomly-named service executable with an embedded payload</li>
<li>Connects to the hidden ADMIN$ share on the remote system via SMB</li>
<li>Drops malicious service executable onto the share</li>
<li>Utilizes the SCM to start a randomly-named service</li>
<li>Service loads the malicious code into memory and executes it</li>
<li>Metasploit payload handler receives payload and establishes session</li>
<li>Module cleans up after itself, stopping the service and deleting the executable.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
However, the most important modification that a penetration tester can make is creating and linking to a custom service executable instead of relying on the executable templates provided by the Metasploit Framework. Failure to do so greatly increases the risk of detection by the target system’s anti-virus solution once the executable is dropped to disk. You can read more about why this is in my September 2015 blog post: <a href="https://www.toshellandback.com/2015/09/30/anti-virus/">A/V Ain’t Got Nothing On Me</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Power Of PowerShell</b><br/>
<br/>
This is all well and good, but what if we could use PSExec tehniques but avoid the whole mess of dropping a service executable to disk and risking detection? Only in your wildest dreams, you say? NAH, BRAH… REAL LIFE!<br/>
<br/>
There is a PowerShell-based version of PSExec within the Metasploit Framework: <b>exploit/windows/smb/psexec_psh.</b><br/>
<br/>
This module allows for PSExec-style functionality but with the added bonus of everything being executed in memory and never having to touch disk! If this sounds familiar, Raphael Mudge (@armitagehacker) implemented a very similar approach within Cobalt Strike. At a high-level, the psexec_psh module works as follows:<br/>
<ul><li>Embed stager into a PowerShell script that will inject the payload into memory</li>
<li>Compress and Base64 encode the PowerShell script</li>
<li>Wrap encoded script into a PowerShell one-liner that decodes and deflates</li>
<li>Connect to ADMIN$ share on target machine over SMB and run the one-liner</li>
<li>Embedded script is passed into memory via PowerShell’s Invoke-Expression (IEX)</li>
<li>Script creates a new service and passes stager payload into it</li>
<li>Metasploit payload handler receives payload and establishes session</li>
<li>Module cleans up after itself by tearing down the service</li>
</ul>
<br/>
This past Spring / Summer, I noticed that the psexec_psh module had been listed as ‘deprecated’ within Metasploit and that the original psexec module had been updated to include the PowerShell functionality. The updated psexec module first checks for the presence of PowerShell on the host, and if found, will leverage the method described above. If PowerShell is not installed on the target, the module will revert to the “old school” method of dropping a service executable onto the victim machine. The PowerShell-related commands within the psexec module can be found under the Advanced settings.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, the psexec_psh module appears to have been resurrected, no longer being listed as deprecated. Confused, I reached out to OJ Reeves (@thecolonial), a well-known contributor to the Metasploit Project, for clarification. I learned that while the PowerShell-specific code is basically identical between the two modules (as I had originally suspected), there have been circumstances where the psexec module fails to execute properly while the psexec_psh module is successful. Until the reliability of the code within the psexec module matches that of psexec_psh, it would appear that the latter is here to stay.<br/>
