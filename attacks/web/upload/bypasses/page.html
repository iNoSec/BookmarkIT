</head><body><b>Filtering MIME type in the upload request</b><br/>
Edit the MIME type to an accepted type in-transit with a proxy like BURP/ZAP. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Using PHP getimagesize() function</b><br/>
Edit comments/exif data/or just insert script into an image itself<br/>
The getimagesize() function will check if it is an image and will check &quot;mime&quot; to verify image type.<br/>
Insecure Configuration :<br/>
<br/>
&lt;FilesMatch &quot;.+\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml)&quot;&gt;<br/>
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php<br/>
&lt;/FileMatch&gt;<br/>
Secure Configuration :<br/>
<br/>
&lt;FilesMatch &quot;.+\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml)$&quot;&gt;<br/>
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php<br/>
&lt;/FileMatch&gt;<br/>
If the service is up an running with the Insecure Configuration, any one can beat the getimagesize function by writing comments in GIF file.<br/>
<br/>
For that an end user need to install an utility in Kali/Ubuntu OS named 'gifsicle'<br/>
<br/>
For Kali Linux : apt-get install gifsicle<br/>
For Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install gifsicle<br/>
Once installed, the below commands will help writing the commands in gif file.<br/>
<br/>
gifsicle &lt; mygif.gif -- comment &quot;&lt;?php echo 'Current PHP version: ' . phpversion(); ?&gt;&quot; &gt; output.php.gif<br/>
The above command will create an file with the name &quot;output.php.gif&quot; which simply need to be upload durning the check of file upload vulnerability.<br/>
<br/>
Truncation possible? <br/>

<b>Blacklisting File Extensions</b><ul><li>Finding missed extensions that can be executed on the server side or can be dangerous on the client side (e.g. &quot;.php5&quot;, &quot;.pht&quot;, &quot;.phtml&quot;, &quot;.shtml&quot;, &quot;.asa&quot;, &quot;.cer&quot;, &quot;.asax&quot;, &quot;.swf&quot;, or &quot;.xap&quot;).</li>
<li>Finding flaws in a web server configuration when it parses files with double extensions or it executes them by providing a sensitive extension after a delimiter such as &quot;/&quot; or &quot;;&quot; character (e.g. &quot;/file.jpg/index.php&quot; when the &quot;file.jpg&quot; file contains PHP code and has been uploaded)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>In Apache, a php file might be executed using the double extension technique such as &quot;file.php.jpg&quot; when &quot;.jpg&quot; is allowed.</li>
<li>In IIS6 (or prior versions), a script file can be executed by using one of these two methods:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>by adding a semi-colon character after the forbidden extension and before the permitted one (e.g. &quot;file.asp;.jpg&quot;)</li>
<li>by renaming a script file's extension (e.g. &quot;.asp&quot;) to an allowed extension (e.g. &quot;.txt&quot;) in a folder that its name ends with the script's extension (e.g. &quot;folder.asp\file.txt&quot;). In Windows, it is possible to create a directory by using a file uploader and ADS (Alternate Data Stream). In this method, a filename that ends with &quot;::$Index_Allocation&quot; or &quot;:$I30:$Index_Allocation&quot; makes the file uploader to create a directory rather than a file (e.g. &quot;folder.asp::$Index_Allocation&quot; creates &quot;folder.asp&quot; as a directory).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changing a number of letters to their capital forms to bypass case sensitive rules (e.g. &quot;file.aSp&quot; or &quot;file.PHp3&quot;).</li>
<li>Using Windows 8.3 feature, it is possible to replace the existing files by using their shortname (e.g. &quot;web.config&quot; can be replaced by &quot;web~1.con&quot; or &quot;.htaccess&quot; can be replaced by &quot;HTACCE~1&quot;)</li>
<li>Finding characters that are converted to other useful characters during the file upload process. For instance, when running PHP on IIS, the &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, and double quote &quot; characters respectively convert to &quot;?&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, and &quot;.&quot; characters that can be used to replace existing files (e.g. &quot;web&lt;&lt;&quot; can replace the &quot;web.config&quot; file). In order to include the double quote character in the filename in a normal file upload request, the filename in the &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; header should use single quotes (e.g. filename='web&quot;config' to replace the &quot;web.config&quot; file).</li>
<li>Finding neutral characters after a filename such as trailing spaces and dots in Windows filesystem or dot and slash characters in a Linux filesystem. These characters at the end of a filename will be removed automatically (e.g. &quot;file.asp ... ... . . .. ..&quot;, &quot;file.asp &quot;, or &quot;file.asp.&quot;). Although slash or backslash characters are also normally problematic characters, they can be ignored in a normal file upload request as anything before these characters may count as the directory name on the server-side; that said, they should be tried for a thorough test (e.g. &quot;test.php/&quot; or &quot;test.php.\&quot;).</li>
<li>Finding flaws in extension detection techniques. A web server may use the first extension after the first dot (&quot;.&quot;) in the provided filename or use a flawed algorithm to detect the extension when there is none or multiple dot characters (e.g. &quot;file.txt.jpg.php&quot;).</li>
<li>Using control characters such as null character (0x00) after a forbidden extension and before a permitted one may lead to a bypass. In this method, all the strings after the Null character will be discarded when saving the files. Both URL-encoded and decoded version of the null character should be tried in a file upload request for a thorough test.</li>
<li>Using NTFS alternate data stream (ADS) in Windows. In this case, a colon character &quot;:&quot; will be inserted after a forbidden extension and before a permitted one. As a result, an empty file with the forbidden extension will be created on the server (e.g. &quot;file.asax:.jpg&quot;). This file might be edited later using other techniques such as using its short filename. The &quot;::$data&quot; pattern can also be used to create non-empty files. Therefore, adding a dot character after this pattern might also be useful to bypass further restrictions (.e.g. &quot;file.asp::$data.&quot;)</li>
<li>Flaws in the protection mechanism when it replaces dangerous extensions. For instance, &quot;file.p.phphp&quot; might be changed to &quot;file.php&quot; after going through this functionality.</li>
<li>Flaws in the uploaded file usage for instance when a PHP application uses the &quot;include&quot; function to show the uploaded images.</li>
<li>somethingwithareaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly.jsp.loooooooong..name......and...periods....jpg. The extra periods and long file name could throw off the blacklist code.</li>
<li>Combination of the above techniques.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Whitelisting File Extensions</b><br/>
Applications that check the file extensions using a whitelist method also need to validate the full filename to prevent any bypass.<br/>
<ul><li>The list of permitted extensions should be reviewed as it can contain malicious extensions as well. For instance, in case of having &quot;.shtml&quot; in the list, the application can be vulnerable to SSI attacks.</li>
<li>Some of the bypass techniques for the blacklist methods such as using double extensions are also applicable here and should be checked.</li>
<li>Null byte injection</li>
<li>Double extensions / invalid extensions (.php.test may error to using .php)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>&quot;Content-Type&quot; Header Validation</b><br/>
&quot;Content-Type&quot; entity in the header of the request indicates the Internet media type of the message content. Sometimes web applications use this parameter in order to recognise a file as a valid one. For instance, they only accept the files with the &quot;Content-Type&quot; of &quot;text/plain&quot;.<br/>
<ul><li>It is possible to bypass this protection by changing this parameter in the request header using a web proxy.</li>
<li>Fool Server side check using GIF8ga; header (example: GIF8ga;&lt;?php code yummy php code?&gt;)</li>
<li>Inject payload into image metadata/comment</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Using a File Type Detector</b><br/>
Sometimes web applications intentionally or unintentionally use some functions (or APIs) to check the file types in order to process them further. For instance, when an application resize an image file, it may just show an error message when non-image files are uploaded without saving them on the server.<br/>
<ul><li>If it reads the few first characters (or headers), it can be bypassed by inserting malicious code after some valid header or within the file's metadata.</li>
<li>Inserting code in the comments section or those section that have no effect on the main file can also lead to a bypass.</li>
<li>The inserted data can be obfuscated or encoded if the application detects a malicious code using specific patterns or signatures.</li>
<li>Uploaded file can be crafted to create a malicious code in case of being compressed by the application.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Client side filters Bypass</b><ul><li>Disable JavaScript in the browser.</li>
<li>HTTP Live Headers to replay the tampered request.</li>
<li>Tamper data using firefox addon.</li>
<li>Proxify the application and tamper the request.</li>
</ul>
