<br/>
One of the most well documented techniques is to spawn a shell from within an editor such as 'vi' or 'vim'. Open any file using one of these editors and type the following and execute it from within the editor:<br/>
:set shell=/bin/bash<br/>
<br/>
Next, type and execute:<br/>
:shell<br/>
<br/>
Another method is to type:<br/>
:! /bin/bash<br/>
<br/>
If either of these works, you will have an unrestricted shell from within the editor. Most modern restricted shells already defend against this hack, but it's always worth a shot. You may be working from a restricted editor such as rvi or rvim, which will almost certainly stop a shell from spawning. Also, try different shells with this technique and ones that follow as some restricted shells may block 'sh' or 'bash'.</body></html>
