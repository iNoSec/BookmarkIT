<title>1099: Java RMI</title>
</head><body>If you see port 1099, thatâ€™s Java RMI. RMI by definition just uses serialized objects for all communication. This is trivially vulnerable.<br/>
<br/>
The entire concept of Java RMI is built on object deserialization, if you can see the TCP ports associate with an RMI service open, and that service has the commons library available, you can pop it.</body></html>
