<title>Changing the KRBTGT Password</title>
</head><body>Changing the KRBTGT account password can be painful – it has to be changed twice to ensure there is no password history maintained. If your domain/forest has been compromised, you must reset the KRBTGT account password twice. It must be changed twice since the account’s password history stores the current password and the last one or ‘n-1’ (sounds a lot like a <a href="http://adsecurity.org/?p=425">trust account password</a>and a <a href="http://adsecurity.org/?p=280">computer account password</a>). If this isn’t done, it is very likely the attacker can get back on the network at some point and generate custom TGTs (aka Golden Tickets) using the KRBTGT account password hash. The KRBTGT password hash which usually has never been changed (other than when the domain functional level was raised from 2003 to 2008/2008R2/2012/2012R2). Ensure you change the KRBTGT account password for every domain in your forest. Don’t leave an attacker any backdoors.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Changing the KRBTGT password is only supported by Microsoft once the domain functional level is Windows Server 2008 or greater. This is likely due to the fact that the KRBTGT password changes as part of the DFL update to 2008 to support Kerberos AES encryption, so it has been tested.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft now <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn745899.aspx#Anchor_5">recommends that the KRBTGT password change on a regular basis</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft posted a <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Reset-the-krbtgt-account-581a9e51">KRBTGT account password PowerShell script on TechNet</a>that will change the KRBTGT account password once for a domain, force replication, and monitor change status.<br/>
<br/>
Note that changing the KRBTGT account password in a 2008 (or higher) DFL will not cause replication issues.<br/>
<br/>
KRBTGT Password Change Scenarios:<br/>
<ul><li>Maintenance: Changing the KRBTGT account password once, waiting for replication to complete (and the forest converge), and then changing the password a second time, provides a solid process for ensuring the KRBTGT account is protected and reduces risk (Kerberos and application issues).</li>
<li>Breach Recovery: Changing the KRBTGT account password twice in rapid succession (before AD replication completes) will invalidate all existing TGTs forcing clients to re-authenticate since the KDC service will be unable to decrypt the existing TGTs. Choosing this path will likely require rebooting application servers (or at least re-starting application services to get them talking Kerberos correctly again).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Microsoft has two TechNet articles which describe scenarios where changing the KRBTGT account password may be necessary:<br/>
<ul><li><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733991%28WS.10%29.aspx">Event ID 14 — Kerberos Key Integrity</a></li>
<li><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc734032%28WS.10%29.aspx">Event ID 10 — KDC Password Configuration</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>
When changing the KRBTGT account password make certain you use a solid password.<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE: Note that when you set the KRBTGT password, even if you set it to “KerberosIsMyPal1!” it will be automatically changed to a complex password in the background. This means that the password you enter when changing the password doesn’t matter, only that the password changes.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, the KRBTGT account is critical for AD domain Kerberos authentication and if not properly protected, enables an attacker to create their own Kerberos TGT “Golden Tickets.” These special TGTs provide the attacker with access to anything and everything Kerberos enabled on the network without having to add themselves to AD groups.<br/>

Note:<br/>
There is a potential issue with Exchange when changing the KRBTGT account password:  <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2015/02/13/considering-updating-your-domain-functional-level-from-windows-2003-read-this.aspx">Considering updating your Domain functional level from Windows 2003? Read this!</a><br/>

<br/>
KRBTGT account pwd / hash only changes:<br/>
	Upgrade of domain functional level (NT5 -&gt; NT6)<br/>
	Bare metal recovery using restore media<br/>
	Manually changed (compromise recovery)<br/>
	In most enterprises, this password hasn't changed in years<br/>
