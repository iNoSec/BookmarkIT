<title>Using DSRM Creds On The Network</title>
</head><body>Using DSRM Credentials over the network<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to use the DSRM Credentials over the network.<br/>
<br/>
When Windows 2000 and Active Directory were released, DSRM being limited to console logon was a good security method. Today, however, there are several methods to logon to a system “at the console”:<br/>
<br/>
  Virtualization Client<br/>
    VMWare Remote Console (TCP 903)<br/>
    Hyper-V VM Connection (TCP 5900)<br/>
  Out of Band Management (Lights Out, etc)<br/>
  Network KVM<br/>
  Remote Desktop Client when connecting to the “Console” which is “mstsc /console” prior to Windows Server 2008 and “mstsc /admin” with Windows Server 2008 and newer. Tested on Windows Server 2008 R2. Windows Server 2012R2 seems to refuse DSRM logon via RDP console.<br/>
<br/>
Once logged in as the local DC’s DSRM account (DC local admin), we can confirm we are on a DC and that this is the DC’s local administrator account. not a domain account.<br/>
<br/>
If DsrmAdminLogonBehavior regkey is set to 2, you can pass the hash with the DSRM hash<br/>
