These require Administrator/System permissions<br/>
These do not persist across reboots<br/>
Each are spawned in a separate powershell process<br/>
Will only run until a successful launcher trigger<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The eventlog backdoor will monitor the system for failed RDP login attempts from a certain username specified by the Trigger value. Because of this, it needs elevated privileges. To trigger an Empire stager, just RDP to the machine and execute a failed login with the Trigger username. The username also needs to exist<br/>
<br/>
resolver will continuously resolve a specified Hostname and trigger the stager when the name resolves to the specified Trigger IP. When you want to retrigger your Empire stager, just change the A record for the given Hostname.<br/>
<br/>
The deaduser trigger will periodically poll Active Directory for a given user and trigger the stager if the user no longer exists. This one is great to set on any backdoor users added to the domain, and can serve as a kind of warning system if admins are onto you.</body></html>
