</head><body>==== Directory Services ====<br/>
A targeted host running directory services may provide an opportunity to enumerate user accounts, hosts and/or services that can be used in additional attacks or provide additional targets that may not have been previously discovered in the vulnerability analysis phase. Additionally, the details of users found in directory services could be used for Social Engineering and phishing campaign attacks, thus providing a possible higher success rate.</body></html>
