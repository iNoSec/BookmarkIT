In some cases, even though a vulnerable SQL query does not have any visible effect on the output of the page, it may still be possible to extract information from an underlying database.<br/>
<br/>
Hackers determine this by instructing the database to wait (sleep) a stated amount of time before responding. If the page is not vulnerable, it will load quickly; if it is vulnerable it will take longer than usual to load. This enables hackers to extract data, even though there are no visible changes on the page. The SQL syntax can be similar to the one used in the Boolean-Based SQL Injection Vulnerability.<br/>
<br/>
But to set a measurable sleep time, the 'true' function is changed to something that takes some time to execute, such as 'sleep(3)' which instructs the database to sleep for three seconds:<br/>
<br/>
https://example.com/index.php?id=1+AND+IF(version()+LIKE+'5%',sleep(3),false)<br/>
<br/>
If the page takes longer than usual to load it is safe to assume that the database version is 5.X.</body></html>
