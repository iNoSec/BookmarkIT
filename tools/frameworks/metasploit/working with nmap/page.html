<title>Working with Nmap</title>
</head><body>db_nmap<br/>
You can run db_nmap and all the output will be stored in the metasploit database and available with:<br/>
hosts<br/>
services<br/>
<br/>
You can also import nmap scans. But you must first output it in xml-format with the following flag<br/>
nmap 192.168.1.107 -oX result.xml<br/>
<br/>
Good practice would be to output the scan-results in xml, grepable and normal format. You do that with<br/>
nmap 192.168.1.107 -oA result<br/>
<br/>
Then you can load it into the database with the following command.<br/>
db_import /path/to/file.xml<br/>
<br/>
Metasploit PortScan modules<br/>
If you for some reason don't have access to nmap you can run metasploits modules that does portscans<br/>
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/</body></html>
