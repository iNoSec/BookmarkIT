</head><body>This can be like Bloodhound. Find the permissions you need and the users who have them. It goes beyond just access to a server. Access to applications, access to change registry settings, access to add/remove users from/to groups, etc. <br/>

<b>Where this gets difficult: Delegated groups</b><br/>
More and more I have seen enterprises move to a system of heavily delegated groups and roles within Active Directory. In this case, the local administrators of your target might be domain groups that contain 10s or 100s of other users. Also, the groups will typically be functional and relate to the type of system being targeted. For example, servers might have the local admin group of “Server Admins” while most workstations might have “Workstation Admin”. Also, network operations personnel and security people often have a local administrator group specific to the SOC or their organization.<br/>
<br/>
This system of heavily delegated local administrator roles increases the difficulty of tracking down users to gain access to a target system but greatly increases the successful chances of gaining that access. </body></html>
