<title>SSH</title>
</head><body>Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic client-server protocol for secure data exchange, remote command execution,<br/>
and other secure network services between two computers that connects, via a secure channel over an<br/>
insecure network. Lucena et al [67] suggest the MAC field for carrying messages up to 160 bits per SSH PDU. To simulate the randomness of the MAC, the embedded messages are previously compressed and then encrypted<br/>
(Table 10). Another way is intermediate nodes to intercept the SSH traffic and inserts an additional encrypted<br/>
message (up to 20B) at the beginning of the already encrypted payload. A 4 byte “magic” number at the beginning<br/>
marks the presence of a hidden message. Hidden message can be carried in the Random padding field [93]<br/>
also, with length up to 255B.<br/>
